commit 18a947ed2253910e1b8f13344f3340632beca94cAuthor: John Stiles <johnstiles@google.com>Date:   Sat Jun 24 11:07:11 2023 -0400    Fix assertion discovered by fuzzer.        SkRP inlines functions at the call site; that will cause all of its    variables to be redeclared. Previously, this could cause an    assertion because we would try to map an slot range to an immutable    variable more than once. This is harmless, so the simplest fix is to    just remove the assertion.        (It isn't safe to check that the slot range is the same as the    previous range, either--our search for matching immutable data    might come up with different-but-equally-valid matching ranges at    different points in execution, since it's hash-table based.)
