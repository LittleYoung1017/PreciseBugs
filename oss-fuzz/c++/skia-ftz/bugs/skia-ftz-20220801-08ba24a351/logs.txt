commit 08ba24a351cfeb2d515e72dcb268d7a37d49b4c2Author: John Stiles <johnstiles@google.com>Date:   Mon Aug 1 18:09:34 2022 -0400    Fix fuzzer-discovered assertion with texture2d parameters.        The Metal code generator would assert if you try to `writeType` on a    texture type, because we don't know the access type to pass (read,    write or both). Places in the code which can support textures need to    call `writeTextureType` instead.        Function parameters weren't considered here, so they tripped the    assert. We now have `writeParameterType` which can be used. For now,    we don't have a good way of setting access type on texture params,    so you will get the default access type (sampleable, no read/write).    In the future we can add `readonly` and `writeonly` modifiers to    pass access information, like GLSL.
