commit e61d3c20533602d575c209cb9ee92af3b8c4314dAuthor: aarongreen <aarongreen@google.com>Date:   Tue May 16 15:34:01 2023 +0000    pw_rpc: Fix types for OSS-Fuzz        OSS-Fuzz includes an image that is using aflplusplus/afl-clang-fast++ as    its C++ compiler. By default, this does not consider unsigned long long    to be a uint64_t, and thus fails to convert the return type of strtoull    to a std::variant<..., uint64_t>.
