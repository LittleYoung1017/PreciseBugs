commit 56e966740c8b78dbbad5934e459a1c723f288dd9Author: John Stiles <johnstiles@google.com>Date:   Tue Sep 6 10:36:03 2022 -0400    Fix fuzzer-discovered error with unsized arrays in structs.        We had a defensive check against unsized arrays, but the fuzzer    managed to get around that by hiding the unsized array in a struct.
