commit e70de5b8a778abab132d25c0d81245cc32550d85Author: Stefano Bonicatti <stefano.bonicatti@gmail.com>Date:   Fri Mar 27 01:25:42 2020 +0100    Fix stack overflow when parsing deeply nested configs (#6325)        Parsing a configuration file as a JSON document    which contains deeply nested elements can lead to a stack overflow    when using the recursive parser of RapidJSON.    Since the configuration isn't changed or parsed frequently,    use the slower iterative parser instead.        Copying the configuration JSON document    that contains deeply nested elements, using the CopyFrom API,    can lead to a stack overflow, due to the recursive nature    of the RapidJSON GenericValue construction.    Detect the depth/nesting level of a config document    and limit it to 32 levels.        Using an iterative parser, while it avoids stack overflows,    can cause memory exhaustion if the config size is too big.    Limit the maximum config size, stripped from its comments, to 1MiB.
