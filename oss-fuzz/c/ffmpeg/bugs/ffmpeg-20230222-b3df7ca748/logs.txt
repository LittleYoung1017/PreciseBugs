commit b3df7ca748bf28e41a6fcb6792b485d8eb04b36aAuthor: Michael Niedermayer <michael@niedermayer.cc>Date:   Mon Feb 20 19:38:00 2023 +0100    avformat/rka: Fix 1/0 with bps=1        Fixes: division by zero    Fixes: 55940/clusterfuzz-testcase-minimized-ffmpeg_IO_DEMUXER_fuzzer-6333107679920128        The decoder does not support bps=1 and i have no such sample so it is not    known if this duration is correct. Alternatively we could error out on all    bps we currently do not support on the decoder side or not set duration.
