    Fix leak when exporting pdf json metadata
    
    Cleanup for the pdf->stats structure wasn't guaranteed when handling
    a fatal memory error. This fix pulls stats cleanup into its own function
    and handles the case where there's a fatal memory error by moving the
    function call below the err: tag.
    
    This fix also removes an extraneous call to pdf_export_json.
