    Fix fuzzer-discovered error with inlining.
    
    In http://review.skia.org/375776, an optimization was added to the
    Inliner, causing it to skip generation of unnecessary temporary
    variables. The fuzzer immediately discovered a flaw in this logic: the
    "unnecessary" variable was actually used in the rare case that a
    function failed to actually return a value. The inliner didn't detect
    this case. Of course, this isn't a valid program either, so now we
    report the error and cleanly fail.
