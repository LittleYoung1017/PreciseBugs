commit 29c294e6842a56ba3b9a24a24a5f6de1575b0961Author: James Bonfield <jkb@sanger.ac.uk>Date:   Tue Mar 10 10:31:45 2020 +0000    Fixed a raft of integer overflows in VCF land.        - Cast data into size_t before multiplication to avoid wrapping around      int32.        - Added checks for return values to align_mem and ks_resize        - Simplified the byzantine calculation in align_mem        - Fixed kroundup_size_t and kroundup32 so they cannot wrap around to      zero and turn the realloc into a free.        - Also added a check for ~2Gb on total length of FORMAT fields, which      nullifies the need for some of the above.  We may wish to remove      this at some point if we want to cope with truely mammoth      multi-sample data, and the above fixes means doing so will not      expose bugs.          However for now this check adds protection against malformed data      creating excessive memory usage and CPU requirements.        Credit to OSS-Fuzz    Fixes oss-fuzz 21139    Fixes oss-fuzz 20881
