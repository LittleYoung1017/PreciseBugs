    oss-fuzz 50893: xpswrite: Fix order of operations freeing TIFF object
    
    We can't free our libtiff "client data) until we've completed writing the TIFF
    (which also frees the libtiff context), but having completed writing the TIFF,
    we can no longer access our client data through the libtiff context.
    
    We have to retrieve a pointer to our client data, complete the TIFF writing
    process, then free our client data using the pointer we previously retrieved.
