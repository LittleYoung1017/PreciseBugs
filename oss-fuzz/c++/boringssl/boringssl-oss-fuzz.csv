The temporary X509_NAME wasn't destroyed if the section didn't exist.    Also document the weird 0 vs -1 convention (see callers), and revise the    NULL check added in    https://boringssl-review.googlesource.com/c/boringssl/+/56705. It    doesn't make a difference, but we should only apply the NULL check after    we've looked at the name, and return -1 because, after the name is    checked, it's a known syntax error.        Also fix a couple of comments that were wrong. It's that the RDNSequence    we take from X509_NAME must have one RDN, not that there's one    RDNSequence. (This is a consequence of X509_NAME's somewhat odd    in-memory representation.)

For set_reasons, it    tried to catch it but leaked memory. Also fix a hypothetical memory leak    in crldp_from_section, but I think it's actually impossible because any    list of CONF_VALUE from a section, rather than from X509V3_parse_list,    cannot have duplicates. It just overrides the previous value.        (Ideally we'd be consistent about whether duplicates override previous    values or are caught, but I'm opting to just leave the existing behavior    alone because no one should be using these APIs in the first place.)

Also add some tests for this syntax. The error-handling here is slightly    subtle. Although we do call GENERAL_NAME_free on the temporary    GENERAL_NAME on error, GENERAL_NAME's value is freed based on the    type field. That means if you add an object to the value but don't set    the type, it won't be freed.        Only the OTHERNAME codepath was affected by this, and a malloc    failure-only case in the is_string path. I've gone ahead and reworked    all the paths so setting the type happens at the same time as setting    the value, so this invariant is more locally obvious.        This only impacts the unsafe, stringly-typed extensions-building APIs    that no one should be using anyway.
