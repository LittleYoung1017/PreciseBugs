commit f0a85e276babcbe8af9390b26bce2d8adf64d7dfAuthor: Even Rouault <even.rouault@spatialys.com>Date:   Mon Mar 20 00:12:13 2023 +0100    loadLayerCompositer(): fix memleak in error code paths        Fixes https://bugs.chromium.org/p/oss-fuzz/issues/detail?id=57261        The manual cleanup that was done was incomplete (it should have called    freeCompositingFilter()), and it is actually useless as the caller    loadLayer() takes care of cleaning.
