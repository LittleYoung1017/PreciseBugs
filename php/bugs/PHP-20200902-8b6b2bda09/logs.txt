commit 8b6b2bda093b26640d0d1d640e4566684df88011Author: Nikita Popov <nikita.ppv@gmail.com>Date:  Wed Sep 2 10:23:44 2020 +0200  Fix by-ref list assign LIST_W+MAKE_REF separation    Shift the responsibility for emitting MAKE_REF to the list assignment  code, to make sure that LIST_W and MAKE_REF are directly adjacent,  and there are no opcodes in between that could modify the LIST_W  result.    Additionally, adjust the zend_wrong_string_offset() code to not  perform a loop over opcodes and assert that the next opcode is  a relevant one. The VM write-safety model requires this.    This is a followup to a07c1f56aac1c0f6c8334760009b678cbf9d6138  and the full fix for oss-fuzz #25352.
