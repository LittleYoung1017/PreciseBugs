    fuzz: codec impl timeout fix + speed ups (#7963)
    
    Some speed-ups and validations for codec impl fuzz test:
    
    * validate actions aren't empty (another approach would be to scrub / clean these)
    * limit actions to 1024
    * require oneofs
    
    Fixes OSS-Fuzz Issue:
    https://bugs.chromium.org/p/oss-fuzz/issues/detail?id=16481
    Testing: local asan/libfuzzer exec/sec go from 25 to 50
