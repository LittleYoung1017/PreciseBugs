    Bug 703902: Fix op stack management in sampled_data_continue()
    
    Replace pop() (which does no checking, and doesn't handle stack extension
    blocks) with ref_stack_pop() which does do all that.
    
    We still use pop() in one case (it's faster), but we have to later use
    ref_stack_pop() before calling sampled_data_sample() which also accesses the
    op stack.
