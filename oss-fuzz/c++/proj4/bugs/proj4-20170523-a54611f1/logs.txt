commit a54611f16cf2140d93f8a33563bbc79af136636aAuthor: Kristian Evers <kristianevers@gmail.com>Date:   Tue May 23 17:37:42 2017 +0200    Fix possible zero division.        For some extreme values of eccentricity a zero divison can occur. In    those rare cases we return HUGE_VAL to indicate something went wrong    while still returning a defined value.
