    fuzz: fix filesystem bug, use std::__fs::filesystem (#7507)
    
    Since OSS-Fuzz minijail prohibits mkdir calls, we use std::__fs::filesystem namespace which implements filesystem.
    
    The OSS-Fuzz image was taking the mkdir branch, since neither filesystem nor experimental/filesystem was found. However, we are able to use std::__fs::filesystem branch in the OSS-Fuzz image and the std::experimental::filesystem branch locally.
    
    Risk Level: Low
    Testing: Add RELEASE_ASSERT(1==0, "") under the #if defined(_LIBCPP_VERSION) && TEST_STD_VER < 17 branch to verify that branch is taken in oss-fuzz docker. run_fuzzer with oss-fuzz docker is successful.
    Fixes OSS-Fuzz issue:
