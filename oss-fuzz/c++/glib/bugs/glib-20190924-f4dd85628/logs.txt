commit f4dd85628af916b58aaead3e8dd25d14d1a7cb95Author: Philip Withnall <withnall@endlessm.com>Date:   Tue Sep 24 18:00:53 2019 +0100    gdatetime: Fix error handling in g_date_time_new_week()        It was possible to pass in (for example) an invalid year to    g_date_time_new_week(), which would be passed on to g_date_time_new(),    which would (correctly) return `NULL` â€” but then    g_date_time_get_week_number() would try to dereference that.        Includes a test case.        oss-fuzz#17648        Signed-off-by: Philip Withnall <withnall@endlessm.com>
