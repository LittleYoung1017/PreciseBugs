commit a028a5e01f2cd627e31f3d3dbdd8fe1f707734b4Author: David Benjamin <davidben@google com>Date:  Mon Feb 6 12:22:07 2023 -0500  Fix leak in set_dist_point_name error handling     The temporary X509_NAME wasn't destroyed if the section didn't exist   Also document the weird 0 vs -1 convention (see callers), and revise the  NULL check added in  https://boringssl-review googlesource com/c/boringssl/+/56705 It  doesn't make a difference, but we should only apply the NULL check after  we've looked at the name, and return -1 because, after the name is  checked, it's a known syntax error     Also fix a couple of comments that were wrong It's that the RDNSequence  we take from X509_NAME must have one RDN, not that there's one  RDNSequence (This is a consequence of X509_NAME's somewhat odd  in-memory representation )    Bug: oss-fuzz:55700  Change-Id: I5745752bfa82802d361803868f962b2b0fa4bd32  Reviewed-on: https://boringssl-review googlesource com/c/boringssl/+/56929  Auto-Submit: David Benjamin <davidben@google com>  Commit-Queue: Bob Beck <bbe@google com>  Reviewed-by: Bob Beck <bbe@google com>
