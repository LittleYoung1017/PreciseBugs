commit b05bbd03f98e5b5857df21dcad04dd8bbe3b2b72Author: John Stiles <johnstiles@google.com>Date:   Fri Sep 24 15:11:16 2021 -0400    Fix for fuzzer-discovered error with invalid var-initializers.        If a VarDeclaration line contained multiple variables, and the first    variable had an illegal initializer-expression, the Declare() would    return a Nop. AddVarDeclaration did not expect to see a Nop and would    assert once we tried to process the second var-declaration. Now, we    allow adding var declarations to a Nop.        Bulked up some tests to cover local and global variables (since those    are parsed in separate functions) and to check both the first    initializer as well as follow-on initializers (since those are parsed in    separate parts of the var-decl handler).
