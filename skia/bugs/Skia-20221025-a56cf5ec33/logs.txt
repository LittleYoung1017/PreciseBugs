    Fix fuzzer-discovered error with overloading main().
    
    The backends aren't equipped to deal with code containing conflicting
    signatures for `main`. We now reject any code that attempts to supply
    more than one signature for main (whether via prototype or a full
    definition). We do still allow prototyping `main` as long as it's the
    same signature as the eventual function defintion; the existing test
    FunctionPrototype.sksl does this already.
