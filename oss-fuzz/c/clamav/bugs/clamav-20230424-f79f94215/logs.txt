commit f79f9421504375d1f970636a891681a67c5dea2aAuthor: m-sola <msola@sourcefire.com>Date:   Mon Apr 24 14:04:41 2023 -0400    html-norm: fix memcpy negative size param        The pointer used to index an HTML file during normalization may be    rewound to an earlier location if encoded javascript (screnc) is    detected while processing the line.        If a <style>-tag was also found in the line after the screnc bytes    then the check for the size of the style-chunk will be "negative"    and would result in a massive memcpy.        This issue was introduced during 1.1 development.        This commit ensures the style chunk size may not be negative.        Resolves: https://bugs.chromium.org/p/oss-fuzz/issues/detail?id=57327
