commit 6ff86030be9e9ca078ad7a1e45616dcd2e45e6b7Author: htuch <htuch@users.noreply.github.com>Date:   Thu Feb 21 14:02:08 2019 -0500    config_validation/server: fix initialization order redux. (#6023)        Another heap-user-after-free, this time we were missing a fix that had been applied to server.h but    not config_validation/server.h (#4940). While working on this, attempted to make fully consistent and as    simple/clear as possible the constraints on member ordering.        This PR is in the tradition (!) of #5847, #4940, #4937. I think long-term we might want to think of    more dynamic and explicit declaration of ordering constraints, it's evidently pretty fragile. Also,    the lack of single-source-of-truth and duplication across prod and config server code bites again.        Fixes oss-fuzz issue https://bugs.chromium.org/p/oss-fuzz/issues/detail?id=13228.        Risk level: Low    Testing: Corpus entry added.        Signed-off-by: Harvey Tuch <htuch@google.com>
