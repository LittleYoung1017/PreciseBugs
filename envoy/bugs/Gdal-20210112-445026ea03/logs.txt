    [fuzz] Fix bugs in HPACK fuzz test (#14638)
    
    - Use after free because nghttp2_nv object has pointers to the underlying strings and copying them resulted in a use after free when the copy was used after the original was destroyed
    - Fixed sorting issues and tested leading/trailing whitespace headers (I can no longer reproduce an issue I saw where a null byte appeared after decoding whitespace, maybe the former fix fixed this)
    
    Risk Level: Low
    Testing: Added regression tests and cases for whitespace headers
