    sds/dns: fix late SDS exception throw during c-ares callbacks. (#4377)
    
    Previously, we only validated local info in SDS initialize(), which could happen during c-ares
    resolution. This is too late to be throwing config validation exceptions, so instead do it at SdsApi
    construction time.
    
    Also, make sure we safely copy exception info for EnvoyExceptions; for libc++ in oss-fuzz,
    attempting to copy/throw the exception in the post() was causing UBSAN failures.
    
    Fixes oss-fuzz issue https://bugs.chromium.org/p/oss-fuzz/issues/detail?id=10262.
    
    Risk level: Low
    Testing: Corpus entry added.
