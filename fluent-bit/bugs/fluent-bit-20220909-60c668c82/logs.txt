    * pack: Fix read Stack-buffer-overflow READ in msgpack_sbuffer_write
    
    This PR fixes Stack-buffer-overflow in msgpack_sbuffer_write revealed by fuzzing:
    https://bugs.chromium.org/p/oss-fuzz/issues/detail?id=45208
    
    The root cause is that snprintf call in flb_pack_msgpack_to_json_format returns the number of characters that would have been written if the buffer had been sufficiently large.
    It leads to reading out of the boundaries of the buffer later.
