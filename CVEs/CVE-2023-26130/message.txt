Versions of the package yhirose/cpp-httplib before 0.12.4 are vulnerable to CRLF Injection when untrusted user input is used to set the content-type header in the HTTP .Patch, .Post, .Put and .Delete requests. This can lead to logical errors and other misbehaviors.**Note:** This issue is present due to an incomplete fix for [CVE-2020-11709](https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-UNMANAGED-YHIROSECPPHTTPLIB-2366507).
