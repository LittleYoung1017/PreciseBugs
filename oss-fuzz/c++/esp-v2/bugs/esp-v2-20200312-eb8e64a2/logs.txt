commit eb8e64a248059f6d5a270b03f5327433469e366fAuthor: Teju Nareddy <nareddyt@google.com>Date:   Thu Mar 12 15:06:16 2020 -0400    [Fuzz bug] Validate logged header format in service control config (#69)        Bug type: User Experience        If an API producer configures an incorrect format for `--log_request_headers`, then ESPv2 will startup and listen for traffic. But when the first request finishes and SC Report is called, Envoy will crash with an assertion fail. This is bad user experience, we should fail early at config time.        Use protoc-gen-validate's well-known types to assert header format in service control config proto. This should not be a breaking API change.        Added reproducer testcase to the corpus.
