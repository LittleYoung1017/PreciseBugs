commit bc75ebb1afc47a03574c02f1ff470949f1cf5b6dAuthor: John Stiles <johnstiles@google.com>Date:   Tue Nov 24 12:04:47 2020 -0500    Fix crash with boolean vectors in is_constant<T>.        Previously, we assumed that if a vector in `is_constant` was not made of    floats, it must be made of integers. This ignores that boolean vectors    also exist. The original code would abort when `getIVecComponent` was    called on a bool vector.        There is another bug here--arithmetic operators on bool types should be    disallowed entirely. That will be addressed in later CLs.
