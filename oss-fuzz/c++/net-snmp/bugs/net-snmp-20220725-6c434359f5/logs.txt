commit 6c434359f549113d0d22f67a401ba5ba9aac7471Author: David Korczynski <david@adalogics.com>Date:   Mon Jul 25 15:30:20 2022 +0100    testing/fuzzing: fix transport fuzzer coverage        This patch fixes an unexpected-exit issue    https://bugs.chromium.org/p/oss-fuzz/issues/detail?id=40640 which    is likely the cause of a coverage failure issue    https://bugs.chromium.org/p/oss-fuzz/issues/detail?id=46588        The problem is netsnmp_tdomain_transport_full eventually forks the    process and also calls exit, which is not compatible with fuzzing. As    such, the function should not be called by the fuzzer.        Signed-off-by: David Korczynski <david@adalogics.com>
