    oss-fuzz 48547/48528/48526: Various TTF hinter fixes
    
    A couple of opcode functions in the bytecode interpreter were not bounds
    checking the values they used.
    
    If a bytcode execution context initialisation encountered an out of memory
    error part way through, the remainder of the context would be left
    uninitialised which could then lead to a later crash when cleaning up the
    partially initialised context.
