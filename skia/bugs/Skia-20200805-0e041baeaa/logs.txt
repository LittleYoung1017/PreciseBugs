    Fix out-of-bounds array access discovered by fuzzer.
    
    The root cause of this error is that Metal does not support upcasting
    a small matrix into a larger matrix (I was unfamiliar with this GLSL
    ability). Proper support in Metal for that type of cast will be added in
    a followup CL. For now, this CL adds defensive bounds-checking to
    placate ASAN.
