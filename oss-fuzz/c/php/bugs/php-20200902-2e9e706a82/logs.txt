commit 2e9e706a8271bbb42ad696c3383912facdd7d45fAuthor: Nikita Popov <nikita.ppv@gmail.com>Date:   Wed Sep 2 10:50:14 2020 +0200    Fix throwing of yield from related exceptions into generator        Use the general zend_generator_throw_exception() helper for this.    Otherwise we don't handle the off-by-one opline correctly (should    we maybe just stop doing that?)        This is a followup to ad750c3bb6e7b48384c6265eb9d3bcf5b4000652,    which fixed a different yield from exception handling problem that    happened to show up in the same test case from oss-fuzz #25321.    Now both issues should be fixed.
