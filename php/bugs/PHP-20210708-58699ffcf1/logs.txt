commit 58699ffcf137154ddd339a0c805996dd8ce80522Author: Nikita Popov <nikita.ppv@gmail.com>Date:  Thu Jul 8 10:04:23 2021 +0200  Fix constant update for shadowed private property    Updating based on the properties info HT will miss private parent  properties that have been shadowed in the child class. Instead,  perform updating directly on the default properties table.    We can't do the same for static properties, because those don't  have a convenient way to look up the property type from the  property offset. However, I don't believe the problem exists for  static properties, because we're always going to be using the  property on the class it was declared on, while children only hold  INDIRECT references. As such, this should be covered by parent  class const updating.    Fixes oss-fuzz #35906.
