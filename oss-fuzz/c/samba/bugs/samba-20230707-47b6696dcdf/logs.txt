commit 47b6696dcdfe7c5cb6e58ac6586ba45d39c39cc6Author: Joseph Sutton <josephsutton@catalyst.net.nz>Date:   Thu Jul 6 10:50:05 2023 +1200    librpc:ndr: Fix overflow in ndr_push_expand        If ‘size’ was equal to UINT32_MAX, the expression ‘size+1’ could    overflow to zero.        This could result in inadequate memory being allocated, which could    cause ndr_pull_compression_xpress_huff_raw_chunk() to overflow memory    with zero bytes.        Credit to OSS-Fuzz.
