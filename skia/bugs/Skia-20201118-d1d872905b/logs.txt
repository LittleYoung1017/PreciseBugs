    Add fix for fuzzer-discovered crash with negated constructors.
    
    This was found at https://oss-fuzz.com/testcase-detail/5155684475469824
    but the associated oss-fuzz issue ID appears to be misdirected (it's
    showing oss-fuzz:24498, an unrelated issue).
    
    PrefixExpressions can return true for `isCompileTimeConstant` but did
    not implement `compareConstant`; the fuzzer discovered this. Because
    compile-time constants can only be compared if they are of the same
    kind, this means that `compareConstant` is actually comparing a pair of
    expressions that are both negated. These negations will just cancel
    out, so `compareConstant` on a pair of PrefixExpressions can just call
    `compareConstant` on the inner operand of each expression.
