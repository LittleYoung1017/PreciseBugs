commit 9d9caf396ad99b19a1dfa5f61cf5f73b51c6c964Author: m-sola <msola@sourcefire.com>Date:   Fri Apr 1 16:39:57 2022 -0400    Fix benign 1-byte stack buffer overwrite when loading PDB/WDB regex signatures        The check of pattern_len against FILEBUF is largely meaningless since    pattern is derived from a strchr() call against buffer (with length FILEBUFF).        This fix ensures that the relative size is checked against max buffer size    which prevents overwriting stack memory with a single null byte.
