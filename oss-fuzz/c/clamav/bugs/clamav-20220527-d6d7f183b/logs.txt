commit d6d7f183bf9c172c0a01f92c16df0ddbf33b05ccAuthor: ragusaa <54862477+ragusaa@users.noreply.github.com>Date:   Fri May 27 21:02:40 2022 -0400    Fix heap over-read when loading some LDB signatures        There is a possible heap buffer overflow read when loading some malformed    logical signatures that use the byte-compare feature.        Previously the upper bound for loop in cli_bcomp_freemeta was hardcoded to 2.    But it's possibly for there to be less than 2 items.        This issue is not a vulnerability.        Changed "2" to "bm->comp_count" to avoid going past the end.        Fixes: https://bugs.chromium.org/p/oss-fuzz/issues/detail?id=43816
