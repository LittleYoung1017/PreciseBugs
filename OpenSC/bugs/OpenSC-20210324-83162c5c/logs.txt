    fixed memory leak
    
    fixes https://bugs.chromium.org/p/oss-fuzz/issues/detail?id=32324
    
    sc_enum_apps() causes card->cache.current_ef to be allocated for
    IAS/ECC, but not freed if any other error occurs during initialization.
    since sc_enum_apps() is called anyway during PKCS#15 initialization.
    Having this at the card driver level (instead of the PKCS#15 level) is
    not needed.
