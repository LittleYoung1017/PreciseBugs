commit 89cd0df3d7d4c2163d79056b5c0ec55c4992c8f4Author: m-sola <msola@sourcefire.com>Date:   Mon Jun 12 19:08:26 2023 -0400    Fixing overread when unpacking PE files        A buffer over-read may occur when unpacking wwpack'd PE files if the    file is very small.    This commit adds a CLI_CONTAINS buffer wrap check to ensure we aren't    reading beyond the exe buffer.        We determined that this issue is not a vulnerability.
