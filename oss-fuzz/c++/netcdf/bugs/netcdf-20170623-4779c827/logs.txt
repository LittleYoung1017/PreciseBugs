commit 4779c8278f67964d9dfc6dc13449543fc15226a4Author: Even Rouault <even rouault@spatialys com>Date:  Fri Jun 23 12:16:53 2017 +0200  Fix undefined left shift in get_ix_int()    Getting the value of the x variable on the file corresponding to the below ncdump output  with -fsanitize=undefined raises    ncx c:1034:14: runtime error: left shift of 128 by 24 places cannot be represented in type 'int'    This is due to *cp being promoted to int before doing the left shift, instead  of the intended unsigned So do the cast to unsigned internally rather than  externally    ncdump file to reproduce:    netcdf temp {  dimensions:      x = 2 ;      y = 2 ;      v = 2 ;  variables:      int x(v) ;      byte y(y, x) ;  data:     x = _, _ ;     y =   -127, -127,   -127, -127 ;  }    Fixes https://bugs chromium org/p/oss-fuzz/issues/detail?id=2356    Credit to OSS Fuzz
