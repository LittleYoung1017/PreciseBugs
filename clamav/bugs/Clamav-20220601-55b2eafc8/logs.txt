    Fix integer overflow/undefined behavior in NSIS parser
    
    Fix integer overflow in the NSIS parser
    
    Cast int32_t to uint32_t for comparison with uint32_t, to prevent
    integer overflow, as well as signed/unsigned compare warning.
    
    Fixes: https://bugs.chromium.org/p/oss-fuzz/issues/detail?id=44493
    
    Also address some other undefined behavior warnings:
    * mpool.c: Fixed pointer overflow errors uncovered by UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer.
    * matcher-ac.c: Test length to avoid passing NULLs to memcmp.
