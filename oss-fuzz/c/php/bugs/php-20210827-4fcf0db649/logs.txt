commit 4fcf0db649835339837a502589732e11f0ce6b57Author: Nikita Popov <nikita.ppv@gmail.com>Date:   Fri Aug 27 11:34:22 2021 +0200    Fix use after free when rebinding __call closure        We would end up freeing the function name twice here, once for    the original closure, and once for the rebound one.        Rather than further special casing the zend_closure_call_magic    case, always addref the function_name for internal functions,    the same we do for userland functions. To compensate, we need to    release the original function name when creating from callable    or call frame.        Fixes oss-fuzz #37695.
