commit 343258fa0ca9113cb36a7f84afd74697058e90b3Author: John Stiles <johnstiles@google.com>Date:   Fri Jan 28 17:15:44 2022 -0500    Fix fuzzer-discovered error with sk_SecondaryFragColor in SPIR-V.        sk_SecondaryFragColor corresponds to an ES2-only concept    (gl_SecondaryFragColorEXT) and does not have any SPIR-V equivalent.        Two fixes were needed:    - sk_SecondaryFragColor shouldn't be in SPIR-V code at all. Report it as      an error when it appears.    - We don't stop compilation when this error is reported, so we need to      fix up the assertion that the fuzzer initially discovered.      Specifically, the fuzzer found that the `sk_SecondaryFragColor`      variable never got a SPIR-V ID assigned to it in fVariableMap, so the      compiler would assert when assembling an expression containing that      variable. Now, we make sure to populate fVariableMap with an (unused)      ID in `writeGlobalVar` to avoid this crash.
