    Fix use-after-free discovered by the fuzzer.
    
    The optimization which replaces unnecessarily nested constructors is
    creating a new constructor from whole cloth, obliterating the original
    constructor and its arguments. This can invalidate the definition map.
    For now, this is fixed by forcing a rescan when this optimization is
    applied.
