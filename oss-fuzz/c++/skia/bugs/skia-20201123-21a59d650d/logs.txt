commit 21a59d650dc8d2171cb779184af2c3a1c420c9baAuthor: John Stiles <johnstiles@google.com>Date:   Fri Nov 20 13:27:04 2020 -0500    Fix double-negation of constant-value construcors.        Previously, the code which calculated Constructor constant values    assumed that a constant-value PrefixExpression would always have an    operand of Constructor. It turns out that another valid case is multiple    PrefixExpressions nested within each other (representing repeated    negation). Updated the code to work regardless of the type of the prefix    operand.
