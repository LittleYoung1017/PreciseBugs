commit d7dbad12f820a72997772ff5e535bee3eb7c5b4bAuthor: Michael Niedermayer <michael@niedermayer.cc>Date:   Thu Oct 11 01:04:34 2018 +0200    avcodec/ilbcdec: Fix multiple integer overflows        Fixes: 10651/clusterfuzz-testcase-minimized-ffmpeg_AV_CODEC_ID_ILBC_fuzzer-5202341540659200    Fixes: signed integer overflow: -1707705920 - 1703592888 cannot be represented in type 'int'        This tries to follow the webrtc code. For example using cliping and 64 bit as in WebRtcSpl_DotProductWithScale()    and not doing so in other places.    I could not find anything in rfc3951 and the reference code inside which would    explain what to do in these corner cases.
