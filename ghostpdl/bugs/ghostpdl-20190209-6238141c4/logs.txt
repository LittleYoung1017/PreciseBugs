    Bug 700384: Indicate error upon error, do not just warn.
    
    Building a Huffman table failed, this was correctly detected,
    but success was indicated to the caller causing a reference
    template to be left uninitialized, which later on caused the
    generic refinement region decoder attempt to use this
    uninitialized data. This was reported by MSAN.
    
    Thanks to oss-fuzz for reporting.
