commit 7a3f25e370aa3be594de0873b8d67ae7ad7a21f6Author: Nikita Popov <nikita.ppv@gmail.com>Date:  Wed Nov 25 12:25:07 2020 +0100  Fix ref source management during unserialization    Only register the slot for adding ref sources later if we didn't  immediately register one. Also avoids leaking a ref source if  it is added early and the assignment fails.    Fixes oss-fuzz #27628.
