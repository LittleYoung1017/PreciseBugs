    avcodec/ilbcdec: Fix undefined integer overflow lsf2poly()
    
    The addition is moved up into the context where the variable is unsigned avoiding
    the undefined behavior
    
    Fixes: runtime error: signed integer overflow: 2147481972 + 4096 cannot be represented in type 'int'
    Fixes: 12444/clusterfuzz-testcase-minimized-ffmpeg_AV_CODEC_ID_ILBC_fuzzer-5755706244857856
