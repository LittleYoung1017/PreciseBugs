commit 8653174539b079063ecf65e964da09cad06e77f8Author: Nikita Popov <nikita.ppv@gmail.com>Date:  Tue Oct 19 11:40:19 2021 +0200  Fix nested WeakMap destruction    This undoes the change from a4b209fdcfe799ab97f55c4c9d22d889813fc266  and addresses the original problem by dropping the unrefs during  shutdown. All objects should get unref'ed without that, and this  code path should only get hit for dangling references due to  bailout.    Alternatively we'd have to relax some assertions that check that the  object is part of the weakrefs table, which seems worse.    Fixes oss-fuzz #40090.
