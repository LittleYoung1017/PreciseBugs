commit 4c8e0b34b7551d42dd2d63c6e6e2976f3ad46a4cAuthor: Herb Derby <herb@google.com>Date:   Tue Jul 18 10:26:37 2023 -0600    Fix data going empty for fuzz        The span named data, reached size 0, then front() was called.    This caused the newly added bounds checking call to trigger.        Add code to exit the fuzzer loop when data has no bytes, and    add a guard so that memcpy and front() are not called when there    are no bytes.
