commit 62ecf54f35e227d09d19ec40920f7bb8d29e9356Author: Nikita Popov <nikita.ppv@gmail.com>Date:  Wed Jul 7 09:36:30 2021 +0200  Fix use after free on compound division by zero    We can't destroy the result operand early, because the division  might fail, in which case we need to preserve the original value.  Place the division result in a temporary zval, and only copy it  on success.    Fixes oss-fuzz #35876.
