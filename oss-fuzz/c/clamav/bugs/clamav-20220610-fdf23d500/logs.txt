commit fdf23d500a7d3987d72533c73a26788d732a2256Author: Micah Snyder <micasnyd@cisco.com>Date:   Sat Jun 4 12:08:51 2022 -0700    Fix possible 2-byte overread when adding sig pattern        It is possible to create a signature pattern that tries to add a    zero-byte matching pattern to the A-C trie. A missing check at this    stage can end up with a 2-byte overread when indexing the (empty)    pattern to make sure the bytes added to the A-C trie are static and    not both zero.        This over read issue is not a vulnerability.        This commit fixes the issue by adding a check for the pattern length.        Resolves: https://bugs.chromium.org/p/oss-fuzz/issues/detail?id=43832        Also added:    - type casts and a "fall-through" comment to silence compile warnings.    - a few additional length checks to protect against an additional 1-byte    over read.
