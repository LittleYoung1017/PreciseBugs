    OLE2: Fix benign heap buffer overflow read
    
    A heap buffer over-read may occur in the OLE2 parser if the --gen-json
    option is enabled (the CL_SCAN_GENERAL_COLLECT_METADATA scan option).
    
    The issue occurs because a string input is not checked to verify if it
    is empty (zero-byte length) prior to use.
    
    We determined that this issue is not exploitable to cause a crash or to
    do anything malicious. The overflow (er... underflow?) is 1 byte before
    a malloced buffer.
    
    This commit adds checks to the function parameters in case the original
    pointer itself is NULL, and to account for conversion of an empty string.
    
    Fixes https://bugs.chromium.org/p/oss-fuzz/issues/detail?id=39673
