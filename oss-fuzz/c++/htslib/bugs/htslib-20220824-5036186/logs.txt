commit 503618637124b3bff51ac545f43378b2665d4691Author: Rob Davies <rmd+git@sanger.ac.uk>Date:   Mon Aug 22 18:44:30 2022 +0100    Fix n-squared complexity in sample line with many adjacent tabs        This could be triggered by a #CHROM line ending in something    like:        ...\tINFO\t\t\t\t\t\t ... many tabs ... \t\t\tfoo\n        Between each pair of tabs, bcf_hdr_add_sample_len() was called    with len = 0, as if from bcf_hdr_add_sample().  This made it use    strlen(s) instead of 0 as the sample name length, resulting in    the addition of a bogus sample name with lots of leading tabs.    The sample line parser then moved on to the next tab, and do    the same thing again with one fewer leading tab.        Fix by making bcf_hdr_add_sample_len() always use the passed-in    length, even if 0, allowing the empty sample name trap to do    its work.  bcf_hdr_add_sample() is updated to call strlen()    itself, and to also deal with the backwards-compatibility    check where it was permissible to call it with a NULL string.
