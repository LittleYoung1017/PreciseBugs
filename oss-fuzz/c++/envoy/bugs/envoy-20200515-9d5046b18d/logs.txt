commit f7a63f14c8159b25bbd90561098cadd7fc68cb94Author: asraa <asraa@google.com>Date:   Tue Jun 2 21:57:18 2020 -0400    [fuzz] fix ext authz send (#11351)        Commit Message: Fixes a fuzz-only bug where on clean-up, the ext authz client `request_` was cancelled, but `request_` was never set because the call was mocked out.        Additional Description: Attempting to cancel a nullptr request would never happen in practice, because cancelling the request only occurs when the filter is in the middle of calling. The cases where `check` doesn't end up sending the request (for eg cluster no longer exists) appropriately change the state to complete.        Fixes issue: https://bugs.chromium.org/p/oss-fuzz/issues/detail?id=22566    Risk level: Low    Testing: added corpus entry        Signed-off-by: Asra Ali <asraa@google.com>
