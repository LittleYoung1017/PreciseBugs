commit 0fcd5ac89d442845254939870107cef40bafceefAuthor: Philip Withnall <withnall@endlessm.com>Date:   Tue Feb 5 13:47:25 2019 +0000    gvariant-parser: Fix parsing of G_MININT* values in GVariant text format        And add tests.        There wasnâ€™t actually a bug on x86_64 before, but it was making use of    undefined behaviour, and hence triggering ubsan warnings. Make the code    more explicit, and avoid undefined behaviour.        oss-fuzz#12686        Signed-off-by: Philip Withnall <withnall@endlessm.com>
