commit ddf89102377a0603d76936a9b0d5a6dafd5bc229Author: Nikita Popov <nikita.ppv@gmail.com>Date:   Mon Sep 27 11:24:52 2021 +0200    Fix DCE of unreachable phi in cycle        We can't remove a trivial phi of the form x = phi(x), because we    don't have a replacement value. We could drop the whole block    though. SCCP would normally do this, but in this particular case    we only determine non-reachability based on type information.        Fixes oss-fuzz #39316.
