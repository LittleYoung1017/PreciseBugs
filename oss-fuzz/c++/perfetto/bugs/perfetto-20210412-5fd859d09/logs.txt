commit 5fd859d098f75ee80624ef032deab1ac33413c8bAuthor: Florian Mayer <fmayer@google.com>Date:   Mon Apr 12 13:09:12 2021 +0100    Fix shared_ring_buffer_fuzzer.        We need to force the spinlock to be unpoisoned in order to make    progress.        Also change type of spinlock bools, to avoid undefined behaviour induced    by a misbehaving client. It is unlikely to make a difference in    practice.        Bug: 185105016    Bug: https://bugs.chromium.org/p/oss-fuzz/issues/detail?id=31646    Change-Id: I89977389b36940b45e88e8482b05f8cb01bcc097
