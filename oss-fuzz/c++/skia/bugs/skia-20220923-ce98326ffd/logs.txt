commit ce98326ffda6c663033613e72f49416a46b1fadfAuthor: John Stiles <johnstiles@google.com>Date:   Fri Sep 23 10:26:46 2022 -0400    Fix for fuzzer-discovered error with dead-local elimination.        Eliminating a dead-variable assignment would turn an expression like    `a = (b = 123)` into `b = 123`. The fuzzer discovered that, after    removing the dead `a =` assignment from the code, we neglected to    recurse into the remaining subexpression. So if the input code was    `a = a = 123;` we would optimize it into `a = 123;` but wouldn't    keep going and eliminate the assignment entirely.        This was invalid because `a` is marked as dead and its declaration has    been eliminated; it can't be allowed to remain anywhere in the    finished program.        We now recurse into the remaining subexpression and optimize it    properly.
