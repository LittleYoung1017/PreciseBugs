Fix that, and more closely implement parsing for the syntax defined in    RFC 6874, which is the amendment to RFC 3986 which specifies zone ID    syntax.

f9d165add	67ba5bfe6	Wed Jul 1 13:28:09 2020 +0100	guri: Fix buffer overrun when decoding %-encoded URI components	commit f9d165add1342ecae6cdde1b95e9ce63320768ddAuthor: Philip Withnall <withnall@endlessm.com>Date:   Wed Jul 1 11:54:05 2020 +0100    guri: Fix buffer overrun when decoding %-encoded URI components        There is a limited (1 or 2 byte) read off the end of the buffer if its    final or penultimate byte is `%` and it’s not nul-terminated after that.    If the buffer *is* nul-terminated then the first `g_ascii_isxdigit()`    call safely returns `FALSE` and the code moves on.        Fix it by adding an additional check, and some unit tests to catch the    behaviour.        This bug is present in libsoup, which `GUri` is based on, but not    exploitable due to how the external API only exposes nul-terminated    strings. See https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/libsoup/-/merge_requests/126    for the fix there.        oss-fuzz#23815    oss-fuzz#23818        Signed-off-by: Philip Withnall <withnall@endlessm.com>

The algorithm for type inference for nested array child types    is not complete, however (and making it complete, at least with a naive    implementation, would make it O(N^2), which is not worth it) and so some    text format arrays were triggering an assertion failure in the error    handling code.        Fix that by making the error handling code a little more relaxed, in the    knowledge that our type inference algorithm is not complete. See the    comment added to the code.        This includes a test case, provided by oss-fuzz.        oss-fuzz#11578        Signed-off-by: Philip Withnall <withnall@endlessm.com>

This,    unexpectedly, accepts minus signs, which can cause an assertion failure    when input like '\u-FF4' is presented for parsing.        Validate that there are no leading sign characters when parsing.        This shouldn’t be considered a security bug, because the GVariant text    format parser should not be used on untrusted input.        oss-fuzz#11576        Signed-off-by: Philip Withnall <withnall@endlessm.com>
eb7c9adc3	da512adc3	Tue Oct 23 17:01:51 2018 +1300	gvariant: Fix checking arithmetic for tuple element ends	commit eb7c9adc3b2570f6b82110b52a24609d124f38deAuthor: Philip Withnall <withnall@endlessm.com>Date:   Thu Aug 16 20:12:02 2018 +0100    gvariant: Fix checking arithmetic for tuple element ends        When checking whether a serialised GVariant tuple is in normal form,    it’s possible for `offset_ptr -= offset_size` to underflow and wrap    around, resulting in gvs_read_unaligned_le() reading memory outside the    serialised GVariant bounds.        See §(Tuples) in gvariant-serialiser.c for the documentation on how    tuples are serialised. Briefly, all variable-length elements in the    tuple have an offset to their end stored in an array of offsets at the    end of the tuple. The width of each offset is in offset_size. offset_ptr    is added to the start of the serialised tuple to get the offset which is    currently being examined. The offset array is in reverse order compared    to the tuple elements, hence the subtraction.        The bug can be triggered if a tuple contains a load of variable-length    elements, each of whose length is actually zero (i.e. empty arrays).        Includes a unit test.        oss-fuzz#9801        Signed-off-by: Philip Withnall <withnall@endlessm.com>
