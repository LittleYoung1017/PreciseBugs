c5ee1bc7	75e53b9f	Fri Jan 7 15:03:29 2022 +0000	Fix opt fuzzer test harness (#4670)	commit c5ee1bc7bd7c8aab529e22925eafe633f8807759Author: Alastair Donaldson <afdx@google.com>Date:   Fri Jan 7 15:03:29 2022 +0000    Fix opt fuzzer test harness (#4670)        The test harness for the opt fuzzer was failing to consider that the    input might use a very large id bound, despite no id approaching this    bound actually being used.        This change modifies the test harness to use the module's id bound,    rather than looking through the module for large ids.        Fixes: oss-fuzz:42386 https://bugs.chromium.org/p/oss-fuzz/issues/detail?id=42386
