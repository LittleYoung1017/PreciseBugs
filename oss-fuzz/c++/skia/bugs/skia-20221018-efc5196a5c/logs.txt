commit efc5196a5c0ecac01fc83ad0dbf77bfa541262f6Author: John Stiles <johnstiles@google.com>Date:   Tue Oct 18 12:16:40 2022 -0400    Fix fuzzer-discovered error with interface blocks.        The fuzzer discovered that interface blocks can redefine a built-in    variable like `sk_Clockwise`. When this happens, we would look up    `sk_Clockwise` and expect to find a Variable, but it's actually a    Field, so we would assert.        Now, we will check that the symbol is a Variable and stop processing    it if it's not one. This doesn't fix the root issue--InterfaceBlocks    should not be allowed to pave over built-ins at all. I've filed a    separate bug (skia:13823) to track this issue.
