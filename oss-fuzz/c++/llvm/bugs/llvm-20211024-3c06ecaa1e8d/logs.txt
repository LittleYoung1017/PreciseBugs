commit 3c06ecaa1e8d0267fe67c1e5c8fa5f294de2aab8Author: Philip Reames <listmail@philipreames.com>Date:   Sat Oct 23 18:07:21 2021 -0700    [instcombine] Fix oss-fuzz 39934 (mul matcher can match non-instruction)        Fixes a crash observed by oss-fuzz in 39934.  Issue at hand is that code expects a pattern match on m_Mul to imply the operand is a mul instruction, however mul constexprs are also valid here.
