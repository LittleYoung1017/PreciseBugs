    Fix debug-mode assert-crash in mail parser
    
    The mail parser uses asserts extensively to detect error conditions.
    It's lazy error handling; good for prototyping but bad for production.
    
    Release mode builds are fine in 0.103 with autotools and visual-
    studio but cmake release builds will crash because asserts are enabled
    even for release.
    
    In particular this assert(0) is a possible error condition in a
    malformed mail file and should be handled properly.
    
    This resolves:
