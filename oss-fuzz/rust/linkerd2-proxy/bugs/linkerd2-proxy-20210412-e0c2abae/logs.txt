commit e0c2abaef9d3743fd4e38e2be8fc8f1ce8ab9083Author: Oliver Gould <ver@buoyant.io>Date:   Mon Apr 12 08:30:31 2021 -0700    Update trust-dns to fix possible panic (#975)        Our fuzz tests trigger a panic in trust-dns when resolving names through    the search path (i.e., in `/etc/hosts`) as described in    bluejekyll/trust-dns#1447.        This change patches our trust-dns dependencies to use include    bluejekyll/trust-dns#6dfc6713 (which has not yet been released to    crates.io)        Fixes https://bugs.chromium.org/p/oss-fuzz/issues/detail?id=33123
