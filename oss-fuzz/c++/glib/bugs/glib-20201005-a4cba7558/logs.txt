commit a4cba755816b75b5a2d821330d121e55c9be6a59Author: Philip Withnall <pwithnall@endlessos.org>Date:   Mon Oct 5 12:10:40 2020 +0100    guri: Fix UTF-8 validation when escaping URI components        The return value from `g_utf8_get_char_validated()` is a `gunichar`,    which is unsigned, so comparing it with `> 0` is always going to return    true, even for return values `(gunichar) -1` and `(gunichar) -2`, which    indicate errors.        Handle them more explicitly.        oss-fuzz#26083        Signed-off-by: Philip Withnall <pwithnall@endlessos.org>
