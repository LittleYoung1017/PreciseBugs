    Bug 705221(redux): "Reverse" original fix
    
    Original fix was to make the chunk freeing code to identify single object
    chunks match the allocating code - i.e. both using the "padded" size.
    
    This appears to cause confusion with other areas in the code, leading to
    potential segfaults.
    
    This reverses that change, so both the allocating and freeing code use the
    unpadded size.
    
    This still solves the memory explosion bug, but doesn't cause the issues
    identified by oss-fuzz 46830 and 46734.
    
    Ultimately it may be preferable to revise the rest of the code to avoid the
    confusion, but this avoids a flood of issues from oss-fuzz.
