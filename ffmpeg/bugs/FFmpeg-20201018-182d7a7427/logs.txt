    avcodec/h264_slice: fix undefined integer overflow with POC in error concealment
    
    Alternatively the POC could be changed to 64bit. the large values seem to be within what is allowed.
    
    Fixes: signed integer overflow: 2147483646 + 2 cannot be represented in type 'int'
    Fixes: 26076/clusterfuzz-testcase-minimized-ffmpeg_AV_CODEC_ID_H264_fuzzer-5711127201447936
