    Fix assertion when compiling oversized interface blocks.
    
    The fuzzer test case creates an interface block which is large, then
    makes an array which pushes past the size limit and returns the
    Poison type. Previously, we would just continue processing and run
    into an assertion because the Poison type isn't a struct anymore;
    `Type::fields()` immediately aborts. Now, we double-check that we
    have a Variable with an interface block type while converting it.
