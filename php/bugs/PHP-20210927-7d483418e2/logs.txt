commit 7d483418e21b8c250f03cbef6480e34e428e6f53Author: Nikita Popov <nikita.ppv@gmail.com>Date:  Mon Sep 27 16:13:33 2021 +0200  Fix relative offsets when copying JMPZNZ    This was doing a plain copy of JMPZNZ, even though it encodes  offsets relative to the opline. As such, the offsets would be  relative to target, while they should be relative to opline.  Fix this by recomputing them.    Fixes oss-fuzz #39295.
