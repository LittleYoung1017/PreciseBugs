commit 763e185671817a55cb41405b787dc411f4935901Author: Martijn van Beurden <mvanb1@gmail.com>Date:   Fri Apr 28 08:57:18 2023 +0200    Hide unreproducible bug that is probably harmless        Issue https://bugs.chromium.org/p/oss-fuzz/issues/detail?id=56395    remains unreproducible to me, and the whole problem doesn't seem    to make any sense. Even downloading the affected build and running    it locally doesn't reproduce the problem.        As this is probably a harmless bug (if it is a bug) that is    triggered by an assert but is handled anyway, I'm hiding the assert    so the handling is fuzzed when the assert is removed, as in    production code.
