commit 9ae6ea0711b3b2bff4f7ab306625c32a82fbde99Author: John Stiles <johnstiles@google.com>Date:   Thu Aug 5 11:49:05 2021 -0400    Fix fuzzer-discovered error with swizzling matrices.        The optimization logic for swizzling a constructor assumed that every    argument to the constructor was a scalar or vector. When it was written,    this assumption was true. However, we recently added support for casting    mat2x2 to float4 which violates the assumption.        We now check every argument and do not attempt to optimize if a    non-scalar, non-vector arg is found.
