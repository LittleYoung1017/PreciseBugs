commit e32d2fba360526bac439079c6d8cf558a89dceaaAuthor: Phelippe Neveu <neveu@pcigeomatics.com>Date:   Tue Jan 12 07:39:37 2021 -0500    PCIDSK: Fixed remaining address and undefined sanitizer fuzzer errors.        These changes fixes the remaining of the pcidsk_fuzzer errors I found using the oss-fuzz tool. Note that I ran the pcidsk_fuzzer for a few days and the only pcidsk_fuzzer errors left are slow-unit errors which I'm not too sure how to fix.
