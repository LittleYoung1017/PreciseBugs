    Fix unchecked allocation in kImageFilter::Common::unflatten()
    
    The bad news is we don't have a good way to validate the count against
    the available data size.
    
    The good news is we don't have to: most filters only use two inputs,
    which will fit in the stack-reserved storage; for those who don't,
    growing the input vector during deserialization should not be
    problematic.
    
    The CL drops the prea-allocation, and instead appends inputs iteratively.
    Also switches the storage to SkSTArray for append/push_back() support.
