commit 68f605bd281a37890ed696555a52c6180457164fAuthor: Martijn van Beurden <mvanb1@gmail.com>Date:   Mon Mar 20 19:21:23 2023 +0100    Fix mistakes in _compute_best_predictor_limit_residual_intrin_* (#572)        I made a few mistakes in these functions, adding instead of or-ing    and xor-ing instead of or-ing. The issue linked below seems to    relate to something completely different, but it is in fact a    result of triggering these mistakes further down the line.
