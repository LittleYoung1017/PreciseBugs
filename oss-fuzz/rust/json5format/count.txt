Initially, this was fixed by replacing    `str.chars().enumerate()` with the more correct `str.char_indices()`.        But after fixing that issue, the selected fuzz test case also    highlighted a parser issue when handling unclosed block comments. This    is an error, but should have been reported as a parsing error (an error    in the input document). Instead it was reported as an internal parser    error.        After correcting the error, I also uncovered an issue in the code for    computing the next line to be parsed (for referencing the source    location of syntax errors). Coincidentally, the fix was in the same    function that had the unicode issue, and fixing it removed the need for    `char_indices()`.        Tests were added to validate the unicode fixes and the unclosed comment    block error handling.
