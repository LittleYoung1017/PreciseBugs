commit b06e2975240de9aca03dd6af5c45bee964678ec4Author: Oleg Oshmyan <chortos@inbox lv>Date:  Sat Feb 4 01:05:29 2017 +0200  Fix integer overflow while parsing \fad(arg, large negative number)    If t3 is initially negative, it should be set to a value larger  than the duration of the event This triggers the `now < t3` branch  in interpolate_alpha (if none of the earlier branches are taken)   The same effect can be achieved by setting t3 to the duration itself     Fixes https://bugs chromium org/p/oss-fuzz/issues/detail?id=531   Fixes https://bugs chromium org/p/oss-fuzz/issues/detail?id=3905   Fixes https://bugs chromium org/p/oss-fuzz/issues/detail?id=11736
