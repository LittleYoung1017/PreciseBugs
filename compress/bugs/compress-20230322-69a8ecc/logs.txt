    zstd: Fix amd64 not always detecting corrupt data (#785)
    
    * zstd: Fix amd64 not always detecting corrupt data
    
    Fix undetected corrupt data in amd64 assembly.
    
    In rare cases overreads would not get returned as errors, if a multiple of 256 bits was overread.
    This would make the "bitsread" equal the expected 64.
    
    Whenever all bytes has been read from memory we start checking if more than 64 bits has been read on every fill. This ensures that an overflow can never occur.
    
    No invalid memory was accessed, this is merely a question if errors are reported.
