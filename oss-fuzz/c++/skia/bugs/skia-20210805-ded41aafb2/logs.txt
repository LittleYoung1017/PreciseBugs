commit ded41aafb2e476aa46ddce025dd48e7a30d23ab7Author: John Stiles <johnstiles@google.com>Date:   Thu Aug 5 12:19:35 2021 -0400    Fix fuzzer-discovered error with SPIR-V interface arrays.        OSSFuzz discovered a minor variation of oss-fuzz:36770 which tickled a    different bug in SPIR-V RTFlip handling; we did not properly handle the    case where the InterfaceBlock is an array. SPIR-V does not support this    at all, but the IRGenerator allows it, and we don't detect it an an    error until later in the compilation process.
