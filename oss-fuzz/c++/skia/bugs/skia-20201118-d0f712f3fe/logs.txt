commit d0f712f3fe9f9a7d0ef654ada5fdf08efcb116f1Author: John Stiles <johnstiles@google.com>Date:   Wed Nov 18 15:18:40 2020 -0500    Add fix for fuzzer-discovered crash at oss-fuzz:27614.        The fuzzer managed to create a test case which temporarily evaluates to    expression `half2(half(0.2)) + 2` as it is optimized. This requires a    bunch of temporary nonsense math as the IR Generator is attempting to    simplify as it goes; various attempts to remove terms from the fuzzer    test-case would cause it to stop reproducing the error.        Constructor::getVecComponent assumed that any constructor with a single    scalar argument would always implement `getConstantFloat` and    `getConstantInt`; however, constructors themselves did not actually    implement these methods. This meant that nesting a scalar constructor    inside a non-scalar constructor would abort when it tried to deduce the    value inside the inner constructor.        This has been fixed by implementing `getConstantFloat` and    `getConstantInt` for Constructors. These methods will assert if the    constructor has more than one argument or is a non-scalar type. This    should allow any number of nested constructors, e.g.    `half4(half(half(half(1))))` should recursively evaluate properly,    should we somehow generate this as an intermediate expression.
