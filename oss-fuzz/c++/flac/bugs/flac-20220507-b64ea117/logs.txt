commit b64ea1171bfa7424d2e3b2ffba50c58fa15769a7Author: Martijn van Beurden <mvanb1@gmail.com>Date:   Sat May 7 20:00:06 2022 +0200    Fix fuzzer_encoder_v2 timeouts        This fixes the 'false positive' oss-fuzz bug filed under    https://bugs.chromium.org/p/oss-fuzz/issues/detail?id=47264        The fuzzer was timing out because of an enormous input (932kB)    combined with very slow settings. The commit disables certain    slow settings on inputs larger than 2^18 byte.
