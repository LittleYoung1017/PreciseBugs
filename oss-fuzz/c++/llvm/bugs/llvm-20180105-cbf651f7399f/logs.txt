commit cbf651f7399feea9ea8495af571d67d924b8ec11Author: Jonas Devlieghere <jonas@devlieghere.com>Date:   Fri Jan 5 10:03:02 2018 +0000    [DebugInfo] Don't crash when given invalid DWARFv5 line table prologue.        This patch replaces an assertion with an explicit check for the validity    of the FORM parameters. The assertion was triggered when the DWARFv5    line table contained a zero address size.        This fixes OSS-Fuzz Issue 4644    https://bugs.chromium.org/p/oss-fuzz/issues/detail?id=4644        Differential revision: https://reviews.llvm.org/D41615        llvm-svn: 321863
