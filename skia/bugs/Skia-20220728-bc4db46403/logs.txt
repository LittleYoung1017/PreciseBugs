    Fix for fuzzer-discovered error with overloaded functions.
    
    The SkSL parser detected types via two functions: IsType and
    IsBuiltinType. These were designed around SymbolTable::lookup, and
    would do a full symbol lookup just to return a true/false result.
    In practice, doing a symbol table lookup on an overloaded function
    name was pretty expensive--it can create new UnresolvedFunction
    nodes.
    
    For `IsType` this behavior was just inefficient. For `IsBuiltinType`
    it was worse--it would create new Program-owned nodes in the built-in
    modules. (This behavior changed subtly at http://review.skia.org/562306
    --previously, we would go through the entire lookup, then just give up
    at the end when we realized we were in a builtin symbol table.)
    
    SymbolTable now has dedicated `isType` and `isBuiltinType` methods
    instead that will never modify the tables. As an unexpected perk,
    this actually eliminates a few UnresolvedFunction nodes from our
    dehydrated data.
