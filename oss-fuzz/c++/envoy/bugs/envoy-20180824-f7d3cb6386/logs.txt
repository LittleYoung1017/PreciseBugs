commit f7d3cb638662f0787699b763134e1e64118d573fAuthor: htuch <htuch@users.noreply.github.com>Date:   Fri Aug 24 16:33:39 2018 -0400    http: fix allocation bug introduced in #4211. (#4245)        There were some non-local invariants that header_map_impl_fuzz_test surfaced around minimum dynamic    buffer size. This PR improves comments and documentation of invariants and fixes the allocation issue    to maintain them.        Fixes oss-fuzz issue https://bugs.chromium.org/p/oss-fuzz/issues/detail?id=10038.        Risk level: Low. It's recommended to bump to this for potential security reasons if you are already post    #4211.    Testing: Unit test and corpus entry added.        Signed-off-by: Harvey Tuch <htuch@google.com>
