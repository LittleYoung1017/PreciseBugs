commit efb261a95c5a81ddb148f205d74eab3714155f0dAuthor: Ivan Nardi <12729895+IvanNardi@users.noreply.github.com>Date:   Mon May 29 19:24:00 2023 +0200    Fix some memory errors triggered by allocation failures (#1995)        Some low hanging fruits found using nallocfuzz.    See: https://github.com/catenacyber/nallocfuzz    See: https://github.com/google/oss-fuzz/pull/9902        Most of these errors are quite trivial to fix; the only exception is the    stuff in the uthash.    If the insertion fails (because of an allocation failure), we need to    avoid some memory leaks. But the only way to check if the `HASH_ADD_*`    failed, is to perform a new lookup: a bit costly, but we don't use that    code in any critical data-path.
