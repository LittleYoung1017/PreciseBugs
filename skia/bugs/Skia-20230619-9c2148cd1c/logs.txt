    Fix fuzzer-discovered error with inlined arrays.
    
    When inlining a function that mutates its passed-in parameters, we
    need to make a scratch copy of that parameter. This is potentially
    expensive for structs and arrays, and in ES2 it may require an
    element-by-element copy since arrays are not first-class values.
    However, ES2 _does_ allow passing entire arrays and structs into a
    function (somewhat surprisingly, given its other limitations on
    array types). The inliner no longer attempts to inline any function
    that mutates a passed-in struct or array parameter.
