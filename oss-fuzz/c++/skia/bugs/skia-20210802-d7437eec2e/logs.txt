commit d7437eec2e9718eda8c8f5cb94ddcef1005c0bfbAuthor: John Stiles <johnstiles@google.com>Date:   Mon Aug 2 11:56:16 2021 -0400    Fix for fuzzer-discovered error in SPIR-V with RTFlip.        SPIR-V code generation synthesizes some extra variables that don't    actually exist in the Program. Checking the ProgramUsage of these    variables would fail; ProgramUsage::get doesn't know about these    variables, so it asserts (and would consider them as dead even if it    didn't assert). We now track our SPIR-V bonus variables in a separate    set, and always report them as live.
