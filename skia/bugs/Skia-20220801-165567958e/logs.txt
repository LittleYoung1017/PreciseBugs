    Fix fuzzer-discovered error with matrix-vector folding.
    
    Previously, `cast_expression` assumed that its input would be castable
    to the destination type. Now, it is defensive and returns null if its
    input isn't convertible. Call sites for `cast_expression` and
    `negate_expression` now explicitly check for null returns and fall
    through cleanly.
    
    Added several additional unit tests to verify this behavior. (I expect
    these tests will expose a bug on at least one or two GPUs.)
