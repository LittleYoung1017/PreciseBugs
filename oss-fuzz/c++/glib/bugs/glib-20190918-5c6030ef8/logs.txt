commit 5c6030ef8da30ef1ade25c55576c1a732d90a23aAuthor: Philip Withnall <withnall@endlessm.com>Date:   Wed Sep 18 12:42:39 2019 +0100    gdatetime: Fix error handling in g_date_time_new_ordinal()        It was possible to pass in (for example) an invalid hour to    g_date_time_new_ordinal(), which would be passed on to    g_date_time_new(), which would (correctly) return `NULL` â€” but then    g_date_time_new_ordinal() would try to dereference that.        Includes some test cases.        oss-fuzz#16103    oss-fuzz#17183        Signed-off-by: Philip Withnall <withnall@endlessm.com>
