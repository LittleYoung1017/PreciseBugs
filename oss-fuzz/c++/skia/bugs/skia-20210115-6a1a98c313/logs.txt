commit 6a1a98c313bfbe24fa140b3ccba0af23676d5beaAuthor: John Stiles <johnstiles@google.com>Date:   Thu Jan 14 18:35:34 2021 -0500    Fix for fuzzer-discovered use-after-free.        The inliner discovered that when a binary expression is inlined, its    type is not cloned into the destination's SymbolTable. This meant that    when the inlined-from function was later dead-stripped, the type pointer    would become dangling. Did a quick pass over inlineExpression and    inlineStatement and ensured that types are always copied.        Also found that `copy_if_needed` was making a copy of eligible types    each time one was encountered, instead of making one copy and reusing    it. This is fixed as well.
