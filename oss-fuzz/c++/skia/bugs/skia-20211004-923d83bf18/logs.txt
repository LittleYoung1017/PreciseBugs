commit 923d83bf18758a59daee4108525d33a7a6fe2526Author: John Stiles <johnstiles@google.com>Date:   Sat Oct 2 10:41:10 2021 -0400    Fix incorrect assertion discovered by fuzzer.        `optimize_comparison` asserted that its inputs were numbers. However,    it's also valid to compare boolean inputs. Fortunately, other than the    over-zealous assertion, the actual logic worked fine.
