commit 7b7d99839c2e2886ecf159952552c9964bd80481Author: Nikita Popov <nikita.ppv@gmail.com>Date:  Mon Feb 15 14:52:38 2021 +0100  Fix symtable cache being used while cleaning symtable    We need to first clean the symtable and then check whether a cache  slot is available for it. Otherwise, it may happen that a destructor  runs while cleaning the table and uses up all the remaining slots  in the cache.    This is particularly insidious because once we overflow the cache,  the first pointer we modify is symtable_cache_ptr, making it hard  to understand what happened after the fact.    Fixes oss-fuzz #30815.
