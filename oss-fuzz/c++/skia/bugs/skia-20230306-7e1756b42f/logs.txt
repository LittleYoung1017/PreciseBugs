commit 7e1756b42f945c66056e57829936fabc920b08a0Author: Jim Van Verth <jvanverth@google.com>Date:   Tue Feb 28 11:53:28 2023 -0500    Fix divide by zero in GrQuad::point().        In ClipStack's shape_contains_rect() we check to see if a transformed    Rect intersects the W=0 plane, but then we outset it, which may push    the Rect through the W=0 plane. In the test case it intersects the plane    exactly, which is not caught by the check. Doing the check after the    outset should address this.
