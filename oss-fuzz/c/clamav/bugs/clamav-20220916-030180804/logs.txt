commit 030180804bf8f5dc38d6b047e553282f4d75a36dAuthor: Micah Snyder <micasnyd@cisco.com>Date:   Tue Mar 15 17:54:26 2022 -0700    Fix benign overread in HTML/js-norm parser        Fix a possible overread in `handle_de()` where we dereference tokens    without boundchecking. The over-read does not cause a crash.        Resolves: https://bugs.chromium.org/p/oss-fuzz/issues/detail?id=44849        Also clean up very sloppy bounds checking in `match_parameters()`.    I don't have any evidence of an overflow. The code just looks sus.        Eliminated a benign warning in `cli_js_process_buffer()`.
