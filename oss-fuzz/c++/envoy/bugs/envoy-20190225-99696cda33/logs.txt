commit 99696cda3336af26fe0b048d91e0d6eb279bb81cAuthor: Dan Rosen <mergeconflict@google.com>Date:   Mon Feb 25 17:41:56 2019 -0500    upstream: fix abort in ring hash lb's config parsing (#6054)        Fixes oss-fuzz issue https://bugs.chromium.org/p/oss-fuzz/issues/detail?id=13327        For ring hash lb, move all configuration parsing from Ring's ctor to the LB's ctor, where it's safe to throw exceptions from. Also, re-add proto field constraints to guard against extreme inputs from clusterfuzz and other actors of questionable intent.        Risk Level: Low    Testing: Added clusterfuzz testcase; existing tests still pass.        Signed-off-by: Dan Rosen <mergeconflict@google.com>
