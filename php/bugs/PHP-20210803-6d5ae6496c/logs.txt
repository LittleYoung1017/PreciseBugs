commit 6d5ae6496c6d1b7a563a0b189d868dd7089be395Author: Nikita Popov <nikita.ppv@gmail.com>Date:  Tue Aug 3 10:19:23 2021 +0200  Fix ASSIGN_DIM to NEXT with rc=1 reference value    The reference wrapper was destroyed while value still pointed into  it and was later used to assign the ASSIGN_DIM return value. This  could be fixed either by moving the return value assignment earlier,  or by working with the value that has been stored in the array.  I'm going with the latter here, because that matches what the  non-NEXT codepath does via assign_to_variable more closely.    Fixes oss-fuzz #36807.
