XWiki Platform is a generic wiki platform. Starting in version 3.0-milestone-1, it's possible to execute a script with the right of another user, provided the target user does not have programming right. The problem has been patched in XWiki 14.8-rc-1, 14.4.5, and 13.10.10. There are no known workarounds for this issue.
