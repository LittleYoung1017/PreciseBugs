    pdfi: Fix font memory leak with "internall" set font
    
    For annotations, we may load and set a font via a different code path than the
    normal, input file driven path. That needed updated to not leak now the font
    is tracked directly by the graphics state.
    
    Noticed when debugging oss-fuzz issue 43565.
