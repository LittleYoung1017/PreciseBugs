commit f9d165add1342ecae6cdde1b95e9ce63320768ddAuthor: Philip Withnall <withnall@endlessm.com>Date:   Wed Jul 1 11:54:05 2020 +0100    guri: Fix buffer overrun when decoding %-encoded URI components        There is a limited (1 or 2 byte) read off the end of the buffer if its    final or penultimate byte is `%` and itâ€™s not nul-terminated after that.    If the buffer *is* nul-terminated then the first `g_ascii_isxdigit()`    call safely returns `FALSE` and the code moves on.        Fix it by adding an additional check, and some unit tests to catch the    behaviour.        This bug is present in libsoup, which `GUri` is based on, but not    exploitable due to how the external API only exposes nul-terminated    strings. See https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/libsoup/-/merge_requests/126    for the fix there.        oss-fuzz#23815    oss-fuzz#23818        Signed-off-by: Philip Withnall <withnall@endlessm.com>
