commit bf4a7d523599c87761a5c650279ee3299401b348Author: Ethan Nicholas <ethannicholas@google.com>Date:   Thu Sep 9 09:32:13 2021 -0400    Fixed DSLParser crash with invalid swizzle        In response to a non-identifier token after a dot, DSLParser would    attempt to swizzle a zero-length field and fail an assertion.        The same basic code path exists in the old compiler, but the resulting    parse error causes the process to abort before it attempts to process    the zero-length swizzle.
