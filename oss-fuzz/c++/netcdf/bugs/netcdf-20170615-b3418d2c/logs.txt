commit b3418d2cd6e8d48adae5f3895a1e16ab9b3b1a84Author: Even Rouault <even rouault@spatialys com>Date:  Thu Jun 15 12:46:37 2017 +0200  Fix undefined left shift in ncx_get_size_t()    Running a build on the nc file corresponding to the below ncdump output  with -fsanitize=undefined raises    libsrc/ncx c:4722:26: runtime error: left shift of 255 by 24 places cannot be represented in type 'int'    This is due to *cp being promoted to int before doing the left shift, instead  of the intended unsigned So do the cast to unsigned internally rather than  externally    ncdump file to reproduce:    netcdf temp {  dimensions:      y = UNLIMITED ; // (0 currently)      x = 109067 ;  variables:      byte t(y, x, x) ;  data:  }    Fixes https://bugs chromium org/p/oss-fuzz/issues/detail?id=2265    Credit to OSS Fuzz
