commit 1989ddc252d936c0893ab50d8b315325b9c55e29Author: Even Rouault <even rouault@spatialys com>Date:  Wed Aug 2 21:54:25 2017 +0200  Fix stack buffer overflow in nc4_check_name()    nc4_check_name() checks that the provided string doesn't exceed NC_MAX_NAME,  but fails to do so after calling nc_utf8_normalize() This extra check is  needed since a caller of nc4_check_name(), like NC4_def_dim, allocates  norm_name as char norm_name[NC_MAX_NAME + 1]    Fixes https://bugs chromium org/p/oss-fuzz/issues/detail?id=2840  Credit to OSS-Fuzz
