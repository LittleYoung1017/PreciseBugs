commit 579f0b307c19efd778d221703ea7743234113535Author: Volodymyr Sapsai <vsapsai@apple.com>Date:   Tue Feb 6 22:39:25 2018 +0000    [Lex] Fix handling numerical literals ending with ' and signed exponent.        For input `0'e+1` lexer tokenized as numeric constant only `0'e`. Later    NumericLiteralParser skipped 0 and ' as digits and parsed `e+1` as valid    exponent going past the end of the token. Because it didn't mark numeric    literal as having an error, it continued parsing and tried to expandUCNs    with StringRef of length -2.        The fix is not to parse exponent when we reached the end of token.
