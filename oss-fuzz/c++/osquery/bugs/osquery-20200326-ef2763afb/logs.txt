commit ef2763afbc53c164186fe9229b926ead23f2a406Author: Stefano Bonicatti <stefano.bonicatti@gmail.com>Date:   Fri Mar 27 03:17:13 2020 +0100    Hotfix a use-after-free accessing rows data (#6328)        When a query triggers multiple xFilter calls    and there's an operation that has to work on the sum of rows    resulting from all those calls, we trigger a use-after-free    when such operation tries to access the rows data.        This happens because each xFilter call we clear the rows    resulting from the previous xFilter call, and because    when returning the values of a text column we don't copy it,    but return a pointer to it.        A contrived example of a query with the issue is:    SELECT path=count(*) FROM file WHERE path = '/' OR path = '1'        This changes the last sqlite3_result_text parameter    from SQLITE_STATIC to SQLITE_TRANSIENT.
