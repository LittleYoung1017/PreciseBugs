commit 17d6efc729e0a973bb4e8f4e19a9d099a8c13b54Author: Nikita Popov <nikita.ppv@gmail.com>Date:  Tue Sep 28 10:35:54 2021 +0200  Fix block marking for two arm math    This would end up taking the successors_count=2 case, even though  we need to treat SWITCH and MATCH differently. This incorrectly  marked a block as FOLLOW, resulting in incorrect block pass  optimization.    Fixes oss-fuzz #39380.
