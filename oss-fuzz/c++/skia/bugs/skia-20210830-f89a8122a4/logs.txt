commit f89a8122a47e9e59bec0f25e1172f9c4f3702047Author: John Stiles <johnstiles@google.com>Date:   Mon Aug 30 15:47:00 2021 -0400    Fix flaws in minus-prefix optimization.        We had a logic bug when attempting to optimize the following code:        const vecN x = vecN(a, b, c);        -x;        The goal was to replace `-x` with `vecN(-a, -b, -c)` but we accidentally    tried to cast the `x` VariableReference to a Constructor. We    unfortunately didn't cover this in any of our test cases, but the fuzzer    managed to synthesize it by mixing and matching elements from its new    corpus.        This affected several different constructor types: splat, diagonal-    matrix, compound and array.
