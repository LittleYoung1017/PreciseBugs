commit 69cf76c58e797d093cea73b1f8ad1ff55ec2786dAuthor: Martijn van Beurden <mvanb1@gmail.com>Date:   Fri May 20 14:55:43 2022 +0200    Fix use of undefined value        The mechanism to improve metadata reading added in 0077d3b overrides    a FLAC__STREAM_DECODER_ABORTED with    FLAC__STREAM_DECODER_SEARCH_FOR_FRAME_SYNC causing the decoder to    overread a buffer into an uninitialized part. A check is added that    ensures searching for frame sync is only set when the decoder is    still in a valid state        Credit: Oss-Fuzz    Issue: https://bugs.chromium.org/p/oss-fuzz/issues/detail?id=47525
