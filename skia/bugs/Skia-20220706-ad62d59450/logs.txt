    SkVertices: Fix out-of-memory errors in deserialization
    
    It was easy to construct a buffer that indicated enormous amounts of
    memory had to be allocated. An easy guard is to bail out if the buffer
    can't possibly fill those buffers.
    
    Simplify the code a bit: Four years ago (well past the earliest
    supported SKP version), we stopped writing out triangle fan data (by
    converting to tri-lists at construction time). Remove the
    deserialization support, which makes the code easier to follow.
