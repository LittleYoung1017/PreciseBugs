commit 072cfdf5b274579f00b21c995a4051e21210b195Author: Martijn van Beurden <mvanb1@gmail.com>Date:   Mon May 1 19:39:20 2023 +0200    Try to fix unreproducible memory leak in metaflac        It seems the fuzzer tries to add a picture file, for which the    file was available during fuzzing but not during reproducing. This    fix seems the most logical place it was failing.        Credit: Oss-Fuzz    Issue: https://bugs.chromium.org/p/oss-fuzz/issues/detail?id=58371
