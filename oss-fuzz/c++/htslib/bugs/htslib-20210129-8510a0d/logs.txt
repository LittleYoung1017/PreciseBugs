commit 8510a0d2a5ac878f1a4b9a6683580bcdfa9196d3Author: James Bonfield <jkb@sanger.ac.uk>Date:   Thu Jan 28 17:06:25 2021 +0000    Fix more OSS fuzz reported issues.        Credit to OSS-Fuzz        - Add bounds check in cram_const_decode_init.          I've checked and this is the only use of the varint decoders that      didn't have a bounds check.  Suitably sniffed out by the fuzzer.      Good fuzzer!          Fixes oss-fuzz 30012        - Free the sub-encoding when initialising XRLE encoding fails due to      malformed streams.  This removes a tiny memory leak.          Fixes oss-fuzz 30014
