commit d0e4840b1178c0a4d59b489ab5ac4a7d4557ce5aAuthor: John Stiles <johnstiles@google.com>Date:   Tue Sep 22 14:00:40 2020 -0400    Fix crash when swizzling a bvec with constant 0/1s.        Code like      bool4 result = val.xy01;        Will now be converted to:      bvec4 result = bvec4(val.xy, bool(0), bool(1));        Previously it tried to do this, but there isn't an implicit conversion    from int to bool, so it was silently failing and adding nulls into the    constructor:      bvec4 result = bvec4(val.xy, $coerceToBool(0), $coerceToBool(1));        This CL also cleans up some related code that I was checking while    trying to understand the nature of the error.
