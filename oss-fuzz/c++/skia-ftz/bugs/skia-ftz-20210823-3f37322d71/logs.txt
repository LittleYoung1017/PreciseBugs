commit 3f37322d71b4c4772719045c29fb023bd5ca4e62Author: John Stiles <johnstiles@google.com>Date:   Mon Aug 23 13:52:17 2021 -0400    Fix const function-parameter assertion discovered by fuzzer.        During constant-folding, we baked in an assertion stating that any    const-typed variable reference ought to have an initial value, because    you can't declare a const variable without assigning a value. However,    function parameters are an exception to this rule! They are variable    references and are allowed to be const, but will not have an initial    value. (In this case, `const` just means you can't alter the value.)        In this case, all we needed to do was remove the assertion; we already    treated this case defensively and with the appropriate care.
