commit 842ee5bd8d6f3aece0cfba4bc623263b9da756c1Author: John Stiles <johnstiles@google.com>Date:   Fri Aug 27 12:37:27 2021 -0400    Fix assertion when calling a built-in function at global scope.        The fuzzer invented a much more elaborate example, but I was able to    winnow it down to a simple otherwise-normal test case. This also fixes    a latent DSL bug; DSL functions were not updating the list of referenced    intrinsics, so the compiler might emit finished programs that called    built-in functions that didn't exist in the code.
