da3388946	48d510ba0	Thu Dec 23 00:47:44 2021 +0100	Fix linking of thirdparty_sleuthkit (#7425)	commit da33889465789ad25870f5cede1ec1bc5238e42cAuthor: Stefano Bonicatti <stefano.bonicatti@gmail.com>Date:   Thu Dec 23 00:47:44 2021 +0100    Fix linking of thirdparty_sleuthkit (#7425)        The thirdparty_sleuthkit_fs_cpp object library actually depends    on thirdparty_sleuthkit_auto but we are not explicitly specifying    that depedency.    Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't (like on oss-fuzz).        Add the correct dependency and also change thirdparty_sleuthkit_fs_cpp    to be a STATIC library, because linking to thirdparty_sleuthkit_auto    causes a circular dependency (which is also present upstream),    and CMake can only deal with that if every library involved is STATIC.

This happens because each xFilter call we clear the rows    resulting from the previous xFilter call, and because    when returning the values of a text column we don't copy it,    but return a pointer to it.        A contrived example of a query with the issue is:    SELECT path=count(*) FROM file WHERE path = '/' OR path = '1'        This changes the last sqlite3_result_text parameter    from SQLITE_STATIC to SQLITE_TRANSIENT.

Since the configuration isn't changed or parsed frequently,    use the slower iterative parser instead.        Copying the configuration JSON document    that contains deeply nested elements, using the CopyFrom API,    can lead to a stack overflow, due to the recursive nature    of the RapidJSON GenericValue construction.    Detect the depth/nesting level of a config document    and limit it to 32 levels.        Using an iterative parser, while it avoids stack overflows,    can cause memory exhaustion if the config size is too big.    Limit the maximum config size, stripped from its comments, to 1MiB.

Added also a regression test.        Addresses https://bugs.chromium.org/p/oss-fuzz/issues/detail?id=19274

We set that to -1, which means that the length of the string    will be taken using strlen().        Addresses https://bugs.chromium.org/p/oss-fuzz/issues/detail?id=18694
