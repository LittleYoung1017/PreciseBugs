commit 8f633ef2b5f72872d89445fc3ce3981f0e49756dAuthor: John Stiles <johnstiles@google.com>Date:   Sat Aug 21 17:13:11 2021 -0400    Fix assertion discovered by fuzzer.        We now stop processing a var-declaration if its array-size expression is    invalid. Previously, we'd pass a null array-size expression into    convertVar, which would assert (but would fail cleanly afterwards).
