OpenFGA is an authorization/permission engine. Versions prior to version 0.2.4 are vulnerable to authorization bypass under certain conditions. Users whose model has a relation defined as a tupleset (the right hand side of a â€˜fromâ€™ statement) that involves anything other than a direct relationship (e.g. â€˜as selfâ€™) are vulnerable. Version 0.2.4 contains a patch for this issue.
