commit b42db1567c55a1d00ff7ecbe9abbbfba9a7d19cbAuthor: Vlad Tsyrklevich <vlad@tsyrklevich.net>Date:   Fri Oct 27 19:15:13 2017 +0000    Fix llvm-special-case-list-fuzzer regexp exception        Summary:    Original oss-fuzz report:    https://bugs.chromium.org/p/oss-fuzz/issues/detail?id=3727 #c2        The minimized test case that causes this failure:    5b 5b 5b 3d 47 53 00 5b  3d 5d 5b 5d 0a     [[[=GS.[=][].        Note the string "=GS\x00". The failure happens because the code is    searching the string against an array of known collated names. "GS\x00"    is a hit, but since len takes into account an extra NUL byte, indexing    into cp->name[len] goes one byte past it's allocated memory. Fix this to    use a strlen(cp->name) comparison to account for NUL bytes in the input.
