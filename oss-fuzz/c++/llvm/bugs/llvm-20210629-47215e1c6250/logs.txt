commit 47215e1c6250298aa9db59b3b06f832fcd23be01Author: Florian Hahn <flo@fhahn.com>Date:   Tue Jun 29 11:54:52 2021 +0100    [LV] Fix crash when target instruction for sinking is dead.        This patch fixes a crash when the target instruction for sinking is    dead. In that case, no recipe is created and trying to get the recipe    for it results in a crash. To ensure all sink targets are alive, find &    use the first previous alive instruction.        Note that the case where the sink source is dead is already handled.
