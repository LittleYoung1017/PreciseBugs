3865cbaec0	210b2a2c9f	Thu Jan 6 09:57:01 2022 -0500	Fix oss-fuzz build compilation errors (#18919)	commit 3865cbaec08c5ce44b439eb77e46fe866e37e81aAuthor: Disconnect3d <dominik.b.czarnota@gmail.com>Date:   Thu Jan 6 15:57:01 2022 +0100    Fix oss-fuzz build compilation errors (#18919)        This PR fixes two compilation error that are happening in the oss-fuzz build of Envoy. Note that the latest oss-fuzz build errors out with only the error related to AsyncStream but AFAIR when it is fixed, a different compilation error has to be fixed which I fixed in the first commit that changes the socket.h file.            Fixes an oss-fuzz Envoy compilation error:    ```    Execution platform: @local_config_platform//:host    In file included from source/common/network/socket_option_impl.cc:1:    In file included from ./source/common/network/socket_option_impl.h:6:    In file included from ./envoy/network/listen_socket.h:14:    ./envoy/network/socket.h:26:3: error: definition of implicit copy assignment operator for 'SocketOptionName' is deprecated because it has a user-declared copy constructor [-Werror,-Wdeprecated-copy]      SocketOptionName(const SocketOptionName&) = default;      ^    source/common/network/socket_option_impl.cc:52:14: note: in implicit copy assignment operator for 'Envoy::Network::SocketOptionName' first required here      info.name_ = optname_;                 ^    1 error generated.

The cases where `check` doesn't end up sending the request (for eg cluster no longer exists) appropriately change the state to complete.

(#6042)        Prepending an empty string seems to mess up libevent internally.    evbuffer_prepend doesn't have a check for empty (unlike evbuffer_prepend_buffer    which does). This then results in an allocation of an empty chain, which causes    problems with a following move/append. This only seems to happen the the    original buffer was created via addBufferFragment(), this forces the code    execution path in evbuffer_prepend related to immutable buffers.

While working on this, attempted to make fully consistent and as    simple/clear as possible the constraints on member ordering.        This PR is in the tradition (!) of #5847, #4940, #4937. I think long-term we might want to think of    more dynamic and explicit declaration of ordering constraints, it's evidently pretty fragile.

Also, make sure we safely copy exception info for EnvoyExceptions; for libc++ in oss-fuzz,    attempting to copy/throw the exception in the post() was causing UBSAN failures.

(#4307)        Previously, we were taking an exception due to the late validation of update_merge_window duration    in ClusterManagerImpl::scheduleUpdate, which happened under a c-ares strict DNS host resolution    callback. There are several related issues here:        1. c-ares is exception unsafe, see https://github.com/c-ares/c-ares/issues/219.    2. We should be validating Durations with PGV, see       https://github.com/lyft/protoc-gen-validate/issues/97.    3. We should defer the c-ares resolution callbacks to be outside the c-ares callback context for       exception safety.        This PR addresses (3) by moving callbacks, even when they are "immediate", to a dispatcher post, so    that we never take an exception under a c-ares callback.        A workaround for (2) is provided, in lieu of https://github.com/lyft/protoc-gen-validate/issues/97,    which is blocked on our ability to bump PGV version in Envoy, see    https://github.com/lyft/protoc-gen-star/issues/28.
