    Fix misdetection of dead global variables.
    
    A global variable should be considered "dead" if it's never written and
    never read. The previous code checked if it was never written OR never
    read, which is not the same.
    
    This would generate GLSL/Metal that didn't compile. In SPIR-V, it would
    SkASSERT, then crash, during codegen. The fuzzer was able to detect the
    SPIR-V issue, but it was wrong in all three cases.
