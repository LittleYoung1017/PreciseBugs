    Fix assertion when performing type-coercion with enums.
    
    In http://review.skia.org/393397, I replaced a Constructor::Convert call
    with a call directly to ConstructorCompoundCast::Make.
    
    This worked fine if the input expression was actually a compound, but
    if it was not, the code would assert/crash. The fuzzer detected this
    error right away. (Enums are not considered to be a scalar, a vector or
    a matrix in SkSL.)
