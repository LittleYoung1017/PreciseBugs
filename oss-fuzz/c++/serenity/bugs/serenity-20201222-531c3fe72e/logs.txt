commit 531c3fe72eb18615dba89bfe673b8a8336abfb89Author: Andreas Kling <kling@serenityos.org>Date:   Tue Dec 22 09:31:33 2020 +0100    LibGfx: Fix OOB access in GIF deinterlacing        It was possible to go outside the interlacing row strid/offset arrays.    Just fail the decode if this is about to happen. I've added a FIXME    about rejecting such images earlier, since it's a bit sad to only do    this once we realize the pass index is about to overflow.
