commit d9ffc81421c7dcf20d88106c5dca34ec35cb610aAuthor: Dmitry Vyukov <dvyukov@google.com>Date:   Tue Oct 5 11:09:48 2021 +0200    pkg/compiler: fix infinite recursion in template instantiation        Fix a bug found by OSS-Fuzz:    https://bugs.chromium.org/p/oss-fuzz/issues/detail?id=17240        We handled the case of infinite recursion in templates    but only if the full type name matches precisely (A -> B -> A).    In this case the name constantly changes due to different    template arguments. Per se this is a not an error    (and we have real cases that use this, e.g. when an nlattr_t    contains nested nlattr_t's), but it's an error if it recurses    infinitely. Restrict recursion on the same template to 10 levels.
