commit 41689ff01f9763bec5fa07a56bc20c8565db619bAuthor: John Stiles <johnstiles@google.com>Date:   Mon Jun 19 10:23:38 2023 -0400    Fix fuzzer-discovered error with void variables.        The fuzzer created some void-typed variables and then triggered the    switch variable-hoisting code. The binary-expression code asserts    that assignments are valid ("We should have detected non-assignable    assignment expressions in Convert") and this expectation is    generally true. However, it was not true for void-typed and    invalid-typed variables; in these cases we would emit an error,    but emit the var-decl IR even though it was known to be invalid.        We no longer emit these invalid declarations into the IR.
