commit 01fb06103d21c199915f0926db44e896f58c07fbAuthor: Martijn van Beurden <mvanb1@gmail.com>Date:   Mon Apr 24 10:53:44 2023 +0200    Fix mistakes in 29d1460 and simplify        Return false was used instead of return -1. Also, overflow is    checked with signed int, which triggers the undefined behaviour    sanitizer. Instead, be a little more strict, such large values    aren't useful in this context anyway.
