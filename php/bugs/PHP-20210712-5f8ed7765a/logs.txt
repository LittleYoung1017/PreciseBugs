commit 5f8ed7765ab2a0ec372fce90701c51ce75312541Author: Nikita Popov <nikita.ppv@gmail.com>Date:  Mon Jul 12 11:24:51 2021 +0200  Fix GC of object properties HT    We partially fixed this in bug #78379, but still don't handle  the case where the properties array is marked as grey first,  which causes a delref to not be performed later.    Fix this by treating the object properties HT the same way as  other refcounted values, including addrefs/delrefs. The object  dtor code already handles properties HT with NULL GC type, so  out of order destruction should not be a problem.    Fixes oss-fuzz #36023.
