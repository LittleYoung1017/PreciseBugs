commit 390edeb88daf4e9bf6331fabe3099639ee4ab005Author: John Stiles <johnstiles@google.com>Date:   Wed Nov 3 10:15:18 2021 -0400    Fix fuzzer-discovered error with no-op arithmetic.        The fuzzer triggered this error in a strange way that involves parsing a    TK_INVALID token. The fuzzer's original input used \xFF bytes in the    shader text to do this. I replaced these with the ` character since it    behaved the same, but allows our test inputs to remain basic ASCII.        The root problem is that `cast_expression`, part of no-op arithmetic    simplification, can now fail because expressions like `int(4000000000)`    no longer get past Constructor::Convert. Previously we had assumed    `cast_expression` could never return null; now we check its result for    null before using it.
