    Fix parsing error with structs containing arrays.
    
    Previously, a struct containing a vardecl with multiple declarations
    would interpret arrays incorrectly. An array would be applied to ALL
    variables in the decl after its initial appearance. That is,
    `int w, x[10], y, z;` would be interpreted as
    `int w, x[10], y[10], z[10];`.
    
    This is now fixed and our test case runs as expected.
