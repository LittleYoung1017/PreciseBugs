commit d3616903588068b441b952af7f227f28b56978c4Author: John Stiles <johnstiles@google.com>Date:   Mon Aug 23 12:40:32 2021 -0400    Fix diagonal-matrix assertion discovered by fuzzer.        This was another place where we needed to use    `getConstantSubexpression` to rebuild vectors/matrices; it is a more    robust approach than trying handle each ctor type individually. The    fuzzer found an edge case with double-casting matrices to vectors that    fell through the cracks with the original approach.        In adding additional tests, I also found a case that the constant-folder    seems to ignore, `bool4(x,x,x,x) == bool4(x)`. This does fold for ints    and floats, so this ought to be fixable in a followup, but it's not a    big deal either way; this is very unlikely to occer in real code.
