commit 05d49cc0cbb66e065856fd696af044d9c8a0fea9Author: Ben Wiederhake <BenWiederhake.GitHub@gmx.de>Date:   Sun May 30 18:44:06 2021 +0200    LibCrypto: Fix bound checks when reading bitmaps        This only affects malformed RSA keys. Instead of accepting and    continuing with potentially broken pointers (and in ASAN, crashing), we    now consider bitmaps malformed, and stop parsing.        Found by OSS Fuzz: #31698, long-standing-bug:    https://bugs.chromium.org/p/oss-fuzz/issues/detail?id=31698        Fun fact: The "if" only exists because of OSS Fuzz.    8cc279ed74dc0b16a187052d2454c26c8c6ecaf2
