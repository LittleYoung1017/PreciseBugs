commit 5d865d574a102501bd8a616f01e52e489ce88e6dAuthor: Ben Wiederhake <BenWiederhake.GitHub@gmx.de>Date:   Fri Oct 22 20:08:44 2021 +0200    AK: Fix BumpAllocator iteration if last object doesn't align        This fixes two bugs:        1. `end_offset` was missing the alignment that might have been       introduced while computing `base_ptr`.    2. Ignoring point 1, `end_offset` computed the offset of the first byte       that is outside the current chunk. However, this might be in the       middle of a (hypothetical) object! The loop treats `end_offset` as if       it points to the first byte beyond the last (valid) object. So if the       last few bytes of the chunk are unused, the loop iterates once too       often.        Found by OSS Fuzz, long-standing issue (since 2021-07-31)    https://bugs.chromium.org/p/oss-fuzz/issues/detail?id=38733    (This probably also resolves some other issues that go through    RegexMatcher.)
