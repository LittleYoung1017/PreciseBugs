commit dd335359e950e52dd5e679da05b5c1f4084e5869Author: Nikita Popov <nikita.ppv@gmail.com>Date:   Tue Jan 5 13:02:30 2021 +0100    Fix infinite recursion in unlinked_instanceof        I suspect this is only a partial fix for the issue, it's probably    possible to recurse through a more complex pathway as well.        Fixes oss-fuzz #28961.
