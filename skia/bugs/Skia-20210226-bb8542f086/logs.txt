    Fix fuzzer-discovered error with ~ prefix on literals.
    
    The expression `~123` was making a PrefixExpression of type $intLiteral.
    It should be converted to type `int` when the ~ prefix is applied.
    
    This change also changes the output from oss-fuzz:27614. Both programs
    are essentially nonsense expressions with no real behavior, so this is
    fine.
