commit c927c59a8426be62f9e9b19e40c862f88b4c17beAuthor: Philip Withnall <withnall@endlessm.com>Date:   Tue Feb 5 15:50:15 2019 +0000    gvariant-parser: Fix error handling when type coalescing fails        When parsing GVariant text format strings, we do a limited form of type    inference. The algorithm for type inference for nested array child types    is not complete, however (and making it complete, at least with a naive    implementation, would make it O(N^2), which is not worth it) and so some    text format arrays were triggering an assertion failure in the error    handling code.        Fix that by making the error handling code a little more relaxed, in the    knowledge that our type inference algorithm is not complete. See the    comment added to the code.        This includes a test case, provided by oss-fuzz.        oss-fuzz#11578        Signed-off-by: Philip Withnall <withnall@endlessm.com>
