commit e8f1ffb50a203c3b2e1f5bb94f493ecb381a43faAuthor: Volodymyr Sapsai <vsapsai@apple.com>Date:   Fri Feb 23 23:59:20 2018 +0000    [ExprConstant] Fix crash when initialize an indirect field with another field.        When indirect field is initialized with another field, you have    MemberExpr with CXXThisExpr that corresponds to the field's immediate    anonymous parent. But 'this' was referring to the non-anonymous parent.    So when we were building LValue Designator, it was incorrect as it had    wrong starting point. Usage of such designator would cause unexpected    APValue changes and crashes.        The fix is in adjusting 'this' for indirect fields from non-anonymous    parent to the field's immediate parent.
