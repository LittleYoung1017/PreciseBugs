A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the handling of wildcard backend hosts of SNIProxy 0.6.0-2 and the master branch (commit: 822bb80df9b7b345cc9eba55df74a07b498819ba). A specially crafted HTTP or TLS packet can lead to arbitrary code execution. An attacker could send a malicious packet to trigger this vulnerability.
