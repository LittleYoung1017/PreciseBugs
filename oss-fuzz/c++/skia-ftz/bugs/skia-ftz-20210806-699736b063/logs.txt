commit 699736b063c4074ee727eb155d03c01ae9dfb32aAuthor: John Stiles <johnstiles@google.com>Date:   Thu Aug 5 16:35:27 2021 -0400    Fix crash in PipelineStageCodeGenerator with recursive calls.        We assumed that any time a function call was emitted, we could look up    the mangled function name in our function-name map and it would exist.    This was not true for self-recursive calls, as the function name is    only added to the map after the function is emitted.        We now use the `functionName()` accessor to retrieve the function name,    which will synthesize a mangled name and add it to the map if it is    missing.        (It looks like recursive calls will not actually work properly, though,    because `writeFunctionPrototype` doesn't emit any code, and the SkVM    compiler can't handle recursion at all.)
