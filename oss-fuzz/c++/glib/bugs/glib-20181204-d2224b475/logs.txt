commit d2224b475d20b544cf782ce046183209d419a012Author: Philip Withnall <withnall@endlessm.com>Date:   Tue Dec 4 12:55:21 2018 +0000    gvariant: Fix error handling for parsing Unicode escapes        When parsing an escaped Unicode character in a text format GVariant    string, such as '\U0001F415', the code uses g_ascii_strtoull(). This,    unexpectedly, accepts minus signs, which can cause an assertion failure    when input like '\u-FF4' is presented for parsing.        Validate that there are no leading sign characters when parsing.        This shouldnâ€™t be considered a security bug, because the GVariant text    format parser should not be used on untrusted input.        oss-fuzz#11576        Signed-off-by: Philip Withnall <withnall@endlessm.com>
