    Fix fuzzer-discovered error with child calls.
    
    The `eval` methods take a shader/blender/colorFilter, and we assumed
    when assembling the ChildCall expression that the child expression would
    be a VariableReference because opaque objects don't participate in
    normal expressions. However, comma-expressions were allowed to contain
    opaque types. GLSL doesn't allow opaque types in comma-expressions:

    Now we disallow them as well.
