    Fix fuzzer-discovered error with inlining unscoped variables.
    
    SkSL forbids unscoped variable declarations as child statements of
    loops or if statements, e.g. `if (true) int x = 123;`. The fuzzer
    discovered that it could synthesize this construct via the inliner,
    leading to an assertion.
    
    The inliner already had a mechanism for adding braces when inlining
    a call into an unscoped child statement like this, but it assumed
    that a single statement would be safe to use without adding a scope.
    Now, it will brace single statements as well.
