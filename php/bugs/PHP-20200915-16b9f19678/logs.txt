commit 16b9f196782281e2bb407f3217695205d8cb70ffAuthor: Nikita Popov <nikita.ppv@gmail.com>Date:  Tue Sep 15 15:06:56 2020 +0200  Fix compile-time/run-time discrepancies with unary operators    This addresses two issues:   * ~ throws for a number of types, and we should not compile-time    evaluate in that case. Add a check similar to what we do for    binary ops.   * Unary +/- may produce a different error message due to    canonicalization of the constant operand to the RHS. To avoid    this, put the constant operand on the RHS right away.    Fixes oss-fuzz #25649.
