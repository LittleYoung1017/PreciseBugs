    Fix SkRP crash when dividing an int by zero.
    
    This adds two instructions to each of the div-int ops:
        d244: 12 9a a0 4e   cmeq.4s v18, v16, #0
        d248: 10 1e b2 4e   orr.16b v16, v16, v18
    
    This is one of our least efficient ops anyway, so the cost of a guard
    is negligible. (`div_int` is 23 instructions. `div_4_ints` is 83.)
    
    This will convert zeros to ~0 (-1). This means div_int against zero
    will negate the number, and div_uint against zero will clear it.
    Since the behavior is explicitly not defined, this is OK.
