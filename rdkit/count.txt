e2b0a850d	f326de01c	Sun Feb 6 05:06:38 2022 +0100	Fix memory safety issues found by OSS-Fuzz (#4983)	commit e2b0a850d7f7087efc15181b8ab11a6b8a566228Author: Alex Rebert <alexandre.rebert@gmail.com>Date:   Sat Feb 5 23:06:38 2022 -0500    Fix memory safety issues found by OSS-Fuzz (#4983)        * RWMol: replace atom in stereo groups        Fix https://bugs.chromium.org/p/oss-fuzz/issues/detail?id=36998, a    use-after-free in initFromOther.        * Fix out-of-bounds write in iterateCIPRanks        If the rank has not changed in the current iteration, the cipEntries    vectors might not have increased in size. Accessing `numIts + 1`    resulted in an out-of-bounds write. This commit skip the cipEntries    update when the rank is unchanged.        Fix https://bugs.chromium.org/p/oss-fuzz/issues/detail?id=28660        * Fix use of uninitialized values in MolSGroupParsing        `stream >> count` may silently fail without an exception. In that case,    `count` was uninitialized but used. This commit initalizes `count` to 0,    as well as other variables that may be read without being initialized.        Fix https://bugs.chromium.org/p/oss-fuzz/issues/detail?id=25220    Fix https://bugs.chromium.org/p/oss-fuzz/issues/detail?id=25225        * Fix vector size cast in streamReadVec        In 32-bit systems, the implicit conversions from 64-bit to a 32-bit    size_t could lead to an underallocation of the vector. This would follow    by a out-of-bounds write while trying to populate the vector. Now, the    code throws an exception in case of a cast that would change the size.        Fix https://bugs.chromium.org/p/oss-fuzz/issues/detail?id=28034        * RWMol: improve atom replacement in stereo groups        This code is cleaner and more efficient.        * Add test for replaceAtom and stereo groups
