commit f2d016f12e224d4a85cd690577cc9a8411731f2aAuthor: John Stiles <johnstiles@google.com>Date:   Thu Oct 28 11:27:36 2021 -0400    Fix for fuzzer-discovered error with negation.        Yesterday's negation-related changes (http://review.skia.org/464123)    exposed a flaw that the fuzzer was able to exploit. We were previously    able to assume that `simplify_negation` would always return a non-null    expression; in some cases, that is no longer true.
