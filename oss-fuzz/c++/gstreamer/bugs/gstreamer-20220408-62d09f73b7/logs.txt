commit 62d09f73b72d574d075b68b227710e47c10311d2Author: Matthew Waters <matthew@centricular.com>Date:   Fri Apr 8 11:10:49 2022 +1000    ogg: fix possible buffer overrun        If an ogg stream does not match our expectations of how the end of a    buffer may be structured, it was possible to read memory past the end of    the buffer parsed by libogg.  Include a bounds check for this case and    stop parsing.
