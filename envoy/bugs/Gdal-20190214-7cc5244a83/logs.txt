    fuzz: fix false positives triggered by H1 codec fuzzer. (#5959)
    
    This PR addresses oss-fuzz issues https://bugs.chromium.org/p/oss-fuzz/issues/detail?id=13081.
    
    This false positive (heap-use-after-free) resulted from a
    misunderstanding around how we handle request/response encode/decoder
    ownership.
    
    As a bonus, fixed stream ID in corpus; it represents an index into the
    list of created streams, not the HTTP/2 level stream ID.
    
    Risk level: Low
    Testing: Corpus entry added, validated under ASAN.
