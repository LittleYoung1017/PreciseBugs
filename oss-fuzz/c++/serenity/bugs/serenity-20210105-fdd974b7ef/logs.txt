commit fdd974b7ef4fb3f38c266f0f16d9b68f84f40bcaAuthor: Andreas Kling <kling@serenityos.org>Date:   Tue Jan 5 12:02:59 2021 +0100    LibJS: Fix UB downcast during GlobalObject construction        When constructing a GlobalObject, it has to pass itself as the global    object to its own Shape. Since this is done in the Object constructor,    and Object is a base class of GlobalObject, it's not yet valid to cast    "this" to a GlobalObject*.        Fix this by having Shape store the global object as an Object& and move    Shape::global_object() to GlobalObject.h where we can at least perform a    valid static_cast in the getter.
