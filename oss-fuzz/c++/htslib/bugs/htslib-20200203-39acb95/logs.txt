commit 39acb9583128ede53d0562a8055786cec0e5ab40Author: James Bonfield <jkb@sanger.ac.uk>Date:   Mon Feb 3 11:52:52 2020 +0000    Fixed nuances between gzip vs bgzf compressed files.        Credit to OSS-Fuzz    Fixes oss-fuzz 20473        This also fixes the indexing tests forbidding samtools index on    gzipped or naked SAM and BAMs.  Previously the index command did not    fail, but gave broken indices.        Ironically with 1.10 samtools index on a totally raw uncompressed BAM    did actually start working (but not gzipped BAM or raw/gzipped SAM).    This was not by design and the indices produced couldn't be used by    1.9 and prior so it's safest to forbid this case too.        Also added documentation on the ambiguous "is_bgzf" field given this    is set for BAM files, even if ungzipped.  It's purely a flag on usage    of the bgzf_open/read functions, which can read uncompressed data, and    has nothing to do with the file format actually being BGZF.
