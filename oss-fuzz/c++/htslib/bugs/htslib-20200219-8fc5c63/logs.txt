commit 8fc5c63123c61ab33afc26264a220c5264cbdb88Author: Rob Davies <rmd+git@sanger.ac.uk>Date:   Mon Feb 17 11:24:11 2020 +0000    Fix integer overflow in cram_read_slice        Occurs when block content_id is INT_MIN, which cannot be    negated in an int.        Casting to uint32_t fixes the problem and allows checks for    negative values to be eliminated.  Blocks with negative    content_id will end up in different hash buckets, but that    shouldn't matter as long as cram_get_block_by_id() is    consistent with cram_read_slice().
