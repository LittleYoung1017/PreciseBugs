commit fabcc9a350087c652252f63b1d3744516e34d57eAuthor: Nikita Popov <nikita.ppv@gmail.com>Date:  Mon Oct 11 12:17:44 2021 +0200  Fix long-term shutdown/tick fci/fcc storage    Normally incrementing the refcount on just function_name is  sufficient. However, if the callable is of the form 'X::y' inside  an instance method, this will capture $this in fcc.object, which  also needs to be retained.    The fci_addref/fci_release helpers should likely be exported as  a general API, as we may have this problem in other places as  well.    Fixes oss-fuzz #39778.
