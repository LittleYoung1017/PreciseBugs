commit fabed8bb79ce17af2988dd38e51a2fd59c48d6deAuthor: John Stiles <johnstiles@google.com>Date:   Mon Mar 29 09:38:59 2021 -0400    Fix fuzzer-discovered error with variable declarations.        As soon as a single VarDeclaration is successfully created, its Variable    is added to the current symbol table. However, if a variable-declaration    line declared several variables in a row, we would stop if ANY of the    declarations contained an error and discard the entire statement, but    would continue processing the rest of the program. This left us in a    position where some Variables existed in the SymbolTable with valid,    reachable names, but their corresponding VarDeclaration statement had    been thrown away as erroneous. Since Variables point back to    VarDeclarations for their initialValues, this gave us a stale pointer.    Any future reference to that variable name which could trigger an    access to its initialValue would read from this dead pointer.        This CL fixes the conversion of VarDeclarations so that we no longer    throw away any VarDeclarations associated with a successfully-parsed    Variable.
