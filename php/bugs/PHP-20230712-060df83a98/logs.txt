commit 060df83a985e9cba523400bbb59462e56d52cf37Author: Ilija Tovilo <ilija.tovilo@me.com>Date:  Sat Jul 8 13:00:23 2023 +0200  Fix double-compilation of arrow-function    We transform the arrow function by nesting the expression into a return  statement. If we compile the arrow function twice this would be done twice,  leading to a compile assertion.    Fix oss-fuzz #60411  Closes GH-11632
