commit a9108f8bfd26da9d5054cce56c5dcd9292181240Author: Philip Withnall <withnall@endlessm.com>Date:   Fri Aug 10 10:28:06 2018 +0100    gvariant: Fix more bounds checking in GVariant text format parser        token_stream_prepare() was over-reading at the start of bytestring    literals (`b'blah'`).        Add tests for that, and for some other situations regarding bytestring    literal parsing, in order to try and get full branch coverage of that    bit of code.        oss-fuzz#9805        Signed-off-by: Philip Withnall <withnall@endlessm.com>
