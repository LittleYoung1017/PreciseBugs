commit 1c6746853f6c40407dc8a801c544e0d72313fc0fAuthor: ragusaa <54862477+ragusaa@users.noreply.github.com>Date:   Mon May 16 21:29:25 2022 -0400    Fixed heap buffer overflow while loading signatures        There is a possible overflow read when loading PDB and WDB phishing    signatures.        This issue is not a vulnerability.        Changed const char pointers to uint8_t pointers when they are to be used    with data, as well as removing asserts and adding additional error    checking.        Thank you Micha≈Ç Dardas for reporting this issue.        This fix also resolves:    - https://bugs.chromium.org/p/oss-fuzz/issues/detail?id=43845    - https://bugs.chromium.org/p/oss-fuzz/issues/detail?id=43812    - https://bugs.chromium.org/p/oss-fuzz/issues/detail?id=43866        This commit also fixes a minor leak of pattern matching trans nodes    that was observed when testing with the MPOOL module disabled.
