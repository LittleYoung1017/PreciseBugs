    Fix issues with SkIsConvexPolygon and SkIsSimplePolygon
    
    The check in SkIsConvexPolygon that determines if a polygon winds around
    multiple times turned out to not be correct in all cases. This has been
    changed to a much simpler one -- if the sign of the edge vectors change
    more than twice, then we know that we've wrapped around more than one
    time.
    
    In SkIsSimplePolygon, if both points adjacent to a vertex are on the
    right side, we attempt to add both those edges to the active edge list.
    However, if they are the same point, then we'll be adding the same edge
    twice, which makes the strict ordering of the edge list invalid. Instead
    we check for this case earlier on and reject the polygon.
