commit be95561917aa9b1d8ea4614820a534917cfa6bbeAuthor: Aleks L <93376818+sashashura@users.noreply.github.com>Date:   Fri Aug 12 14:48:41 2022 +0100    Fix Heap-buffer-overflow READ in opj_jp2_apply_pclr (#1441)        The issue was found while fuzzing opencv:    https://bugs.chromium.org/p/oss-fuzz/issues/detail?id=47342        The read overflow triggered by reading `src[j]` in    ```cpp                for (j = 0; j < max; ++j) {                    dst[j] = src[j];                }    ```    The max is calculated as `new_comps[pcol].w * new_comps[pcol].h`, however the `src = old_comps[cmp].data;` which may have different `w` and `h` dimensions.
