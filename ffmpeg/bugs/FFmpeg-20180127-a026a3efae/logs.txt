    avcodec/hevc_cabac: Check prefix so as to avoid invalid shifts in coeff_abs_level_remaining_decode()
    
    I suspect that this can be limited tighter, but i failed to find anything
    in the spec that would confirm that.
    
    Fixes: 4833/clusterfuzz-testcase-minimized-5302840101699584
    Fixes: runtime error: left shift of 134217730 by 4 places cannot be represented in type 'int'
