(#6042)        Prepending an empty string seems to mess up libevent internally.    evbuffer_prepend doesn't have a check for empty (unlike evbuffer_prepend_buffer    which does). This then results in an allocation of an empty chain, which causes    problems with a following move/append. This only seems to happen the the    original buffer was created via addBufferFragment(), this forces the code    execution path in evbuffer_prepend related to immutable buffers.

(#6023)        Another heap-user-after-free, this time we were missing a fix that had been applied to server.h but    not config_validation/server.h (#4940). While working on this, attempted to make fully consistent and as    simple/clear as possible the constraints on member ordering.        This PR is in the tradition (!) of #5847, #4940, #4937. I think long-term we might want to think of    more dynamic and explicit declaration of ordering constraints, it's evidently pretty fragile. Also,    the lack of single-source-of-truth and duplication across prod and config server code bites again.

(#5863)	commit 5fd128d63810919840917bdf7da2d018edc5e32fAuthor: htuch <htuch@users.noreply.github.com>Date:   Wed Feb 6 18:23:29 2019 -0500    maglev: fix handling of unspecified locality weights. (#5863)        The config fuzzer showed that the locality weight assertion in    https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/pull/5831 was too strong. Extant behavior was and is that if    locality weight is not specified and locality LB weighting, we should just ignore the locality.        Fixes oss-fuzz issue https://bugs.chromium.org/p/oss-fuzz/issues/detail?id=12923.        Risk level: Low    Testing: Corpus entry and unit test added.

(#4377)        Previously, we only validated local info in SDS initialize(), which could happen during c-ares    resolution. This is too late to be throwing config validation exceptions, so instead do it at SdsApi    construction time.        Also, make sure we safely copy exception info for EnvoyExceptions; for libc++ in oss-fuzz,    attempting to copy/throw the exception in the post() was causing UBSAN failures.

(#4307)	commit 1d34172bd058f31956741ec5f3346339fc624fd0Author: htuch <htuch@users.noreply.github.com>Date:   Fri Aug 31 10:41:27 2018 -0400    dns: fix exception unsafe behavior in c-ares callbacks. (#4307)        Previously, we were taking an exception due to the late validation of update_merge_window duration    in ClusterManagerImpl::scheduleUpdate, which happened under a c-ares strict DNS host resolution    callback. There are several related issues here:        1. c-ares is exception unsafe, see https://github.com/c-ares/c-ares/issues/219.    2. We should be validating Durations with PGV, see       https://github.com/lyft/protoc-gen-validate/issues/97.    3. We should defer the c-ares resolution callbacks to be outside the c-ares callback context for       exception safety.        This PR addresses (3) by moving callbacks, even when they are "immediate", to a dispatcher post, so    that we never take an exception under a c-ares callback.        A workaround for (2) is provided, in lieu of https://github.com/lyft/protoc-gen-validate/issues/97,    which is blocked on our ability to bump PGV version in Envoy, see    https://github.com/lyft/protoc-gen-star/issues/28.        Fixes oss-fuzz issue https://bugs.chromium.org/p/oss-fuzz/issues/detail?id=9868.        Risk level: Medium (DNS clusters will have some timing changes).
