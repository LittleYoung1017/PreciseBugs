commit 5cad2f68f2a68c8c6854d0bfc62700299598dfa1Author: Even Rouault <even.rouault@spatialys.com>Date:   Wed Mar 27 18:55:35 2019 +0100    ocea: fix behaviour when +alpha is specified        The one-point case was completely broken with lat_0 being ignored.    I've fixed that, and also modified the alpha orientation, so that the angle    corresponds to the one of the 2 point case when going from point 1 to point 2,    similarly to what omerc does.    This was found rather experimentaly with the added test cases that try to    find equivalence between 1-point and 2-point cases.        Fixes #1379    and adresses https://bugs.chromium.org/p/oss-fuzz/issues/detail?id=13930
