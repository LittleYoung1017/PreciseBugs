commit 0bde7c65275ef4fcd51bc92e1b6c280f9888b73fAuthor: Roman Lebedev <lebedev.ri@gmail.com>Date:   Tue Jul 2 12:54:48 2019 +0000    [InstCombine] Shift amount reassociation: fixup constantexpr handling (PR42484)        I was actually wondering if there was some nicer way than m_Value()+cast,    but apparently what i was really "subconsciously" thinking about    was correctness issue.        hasNoUnsignedWrap()/hasNoUnsignedWrap() exist for Instruction,    not for BinaryOperator, so let's just use m_Instruction(),    thus both avoiding a cast, and a crash.
