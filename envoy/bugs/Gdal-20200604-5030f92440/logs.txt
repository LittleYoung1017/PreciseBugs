    fix all filter fuzz bugs (#11422)
    
    Closes fuzz bugs related to configuration and test issues in filter_fuzz_test
    
    * Require that encodeComplete() is called after end_stream/trailers per the HCM/filter contract. Otherwise, you run into destruction issues.
    * TAP configuration can't use unimplemented TapDS configuration. Had to enforce in code because it's a oneof, which can only be constrained to be required
    * Squash filter configuration requires some JSON attachment template. Scrubbed if invalid JSON
    
    Risk Level: Low
    Testing: Regression corpuses added, fuzzer runs for a 2 minutes
    Fixes OSS-fuzz issues:
