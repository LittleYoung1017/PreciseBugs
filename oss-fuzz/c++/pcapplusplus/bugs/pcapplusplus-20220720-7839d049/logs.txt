commit 7839d0493830d19bd02f84590187553509b21ee8Author: Aleks L <93376818+sashashura@users.noreply.github.com>Date:   Wed Jul 20 09:37:05 2022 +0100    Fixes Heap-buffer-overflow READ in pcpp::cross_platform_memmem (#914)        * Fixes Heap-buffer-overflow READ in pcpp::cross_platform_memmem        Fixes Heap-buffer-overflow READ in pcpp::cross_platform_memmem:    https://bugs.chromium.org/p/oss-fuzz/issues/detail?id=43408        The `haystackLen` for `cross_platform_memmem` call in `SipRequestFirstLine::parseVersion` is calculated as `m_SipRequest->getDataLen() - m_UriOffset`. However when `m_DataLen` is 4 and `m_UriOffset` is 5 it results in -1 which is converted into max uint64. This leads to memory read out of data buffer bounds.        * Remove trailing tab        * Add the regression test
