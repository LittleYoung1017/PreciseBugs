    Fix style parsing with better style.
    
    SkFontStyle needs to be updated to take scalar weight and width, and
    separate slant and italic into separate scalar values. Since there are
    currently issues with serialization of SkFontStyle, start with the
    serialization and deserialization before moving these changes up into
    SkFontStyle and its users itself.
