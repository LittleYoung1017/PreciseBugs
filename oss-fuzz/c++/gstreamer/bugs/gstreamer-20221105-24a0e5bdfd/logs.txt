commit 24a0e5bdfdb42217ee93ff858abcc35bad821bf7Author: Edward Hervey <edward@centricular.com>Date:   Sat Nov 5 07:34:27 2022 +0100    subparse: Fix non-closed tag handling.        Unclear what the goal was, but we could end up reading way past the next_tag.        Instead just move everything from after the end tag ('>') to the next_tag.
