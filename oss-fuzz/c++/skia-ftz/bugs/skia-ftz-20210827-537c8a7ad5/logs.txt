commit 537c8a7ad56db045632966af55fe98a701bd6409Author: John Stiles <johnstiles@google.com>Date:   Fri Aug 27 11:07:09 2021 -0400    Fix assertion when returning intermediate types.        The fuzzer managed to trigger an assertion by returning an invalid type    from a void function. We were neglecting to clear out the expression    when reporting it as invalid, leaving it for `checkValid` to find later.
