    Fix fuzzer-discovered error with repeated assignment.
    
    The fuzzer discovered a subtle bug with our recent optimization,
    which fused variable declarations with their initialization.
    Specifically, the statement pair `int x = 0; x = x = 1;` is valid
    (though questionable) SkSL. However, `int x = x = 1;` is not. We
    now properly detect this case and leave it as-is.
