    avcodec/wavpack: Fix overflow in p=31
    
    Untested with "non fuzzed" samples as i have no such file
    The reference 5.6.0 decoder appears to also have undefined behavior in the lossless codepath for this
    
    Fixes: shift exponent 32 is too large for 32-bit type 'int'
    Fixes: 50930/clusterfuzz-testcase-minimized-ffmpeg_AV_CODEC_ID_WAVPACK_fuzzer-6319201949712384
