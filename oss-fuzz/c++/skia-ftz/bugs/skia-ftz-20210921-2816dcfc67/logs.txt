commit 2816dcfc6775e75c7aba5978e835a147dda4ac1cAuthor: Ethan Nicholas <ethannicholas@google.com>Date:   Tue Sep 21 09:18:47 2021 -0400    Fixed fuzzer-discovered bug with interface blocks        While I was in this code, I realized that the setVariable method of    InterfaceBlock was unused and there was therefore no reason to be    storing a pointer instead of a reference.
