    avcodec/fft_template: Fix multiple runtime error: signed integer overflow: -1943918714 - 1935113003 cannot be represented in type 'int'
    
    Fixes: 1735/clusterfuzz-testcase-minimized-5350472347025408
    
    This uses unsigned instead of SUINT because the later was rejected by multiple developers
