commit 322e0b3693fa43d281ffe082a1e08e523e8dd17fAuthor: Todd C Miller <Todd Miller@sudo ws>Date:  Mon Feb 22 19:53:08 2021 -0700  Return NOT_FOUND from the set_cmnd_path() stub since we don't set user_cmnd   The purpose of set_cmnd_path() is to reset user_cmnd based on a new  runchroot  For the stub version we don't modify user_cmnd and so  must not return a status of FOUND   Fixes oss-fuzz 31250 which only affected the fuzzer and not sudo
