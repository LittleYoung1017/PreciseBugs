commit 22b6aac66fbb64dd479b4a34ac3a7af7a40adad9Author: Nikita Popov <nikita.ppv@gmail.com>Date:  Tue Oct 19 13:12:37 2021 +0200  Fix inc/dec of undef var with error handler    Set the variable to null after emitting the undef var notice  rather than before. This avoids an assertion failure if the var  is unset by the error handler.    The flip side is that this may cause a leak instead, but that's  the more harmless outcome.    Fixes oss-fuzz #36604.
