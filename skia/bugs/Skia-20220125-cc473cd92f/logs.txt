    Fix fuzzer-discovered error with swizzles.
    
    Some paths through swizzle optimization would replace a swizzles with a
    constructor--e.g. `float3(1, 2, 3).y` would be replaced with `float(2)`.
    (Constructor::Convert was responsible for replacing this trivial
    constructor with the literal `2.0`.)
    
    The optimization code asserted that this replacement would succeed, but
    the fuzzer managed to construct a counterexample where the constructor
    rejected the value. Specifically, by nesting casts between int3 and
    float3, it found a case where Constructor::Convert returned null because
    the literal value was out of range for `int` types.
    
    This assertion didn't really add value so removing it was harmless.
    Constructor::Convert already reports an error when it fails, and null
    returns are handled properly throughout.
