    Fix for-statement assertion detected by the fuzzer.
    
    The fuzzer found that the `DetectVarDeclarationWithoutScope` check was
    placed too late in the function, and could be skipped over by for-loops
    containing multiple variables. This was caught in ForStatement::Make,
    which mirrors the Convert postconditions with matching assertions.
