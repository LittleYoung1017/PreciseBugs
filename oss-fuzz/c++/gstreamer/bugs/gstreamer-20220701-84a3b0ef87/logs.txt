commit 84a3b0ef87e1b4eebe3ebef2c0de620a40afe4c1Author: Tim-Philipp MÃ¼ller <tim@centricular.com>Date:   Thu Jun 30 00:13:19 2022 +0100    samiparse: fix handling of self-closing tags        We would check the wrong string (rest of line rather than element)    for the / suffix of self-closing tags, which is not only wrong but    also has atrocious performance with certain strings like the garbled    nonsense clusterfuzz feeds us, which might cause discoverer to time    out when processing garbled SAMI files.        Fixes https://bugs.chromium.org/p/oss-fuzz/issues/detail?id=47461        Part-of: <https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/gstreamer/gstreamer/-/merge_requests/2685>
