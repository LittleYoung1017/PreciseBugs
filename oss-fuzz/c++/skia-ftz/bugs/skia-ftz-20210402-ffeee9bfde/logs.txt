commit ffeee9bfdeba868c53badee8285d37576dca9adeAuthor: Jim Van Verth <jvanverth@google.com>Date:   Fri Apr 2 15:42:35 2021 -0400    Fix lost precision case in SkComputeRadialSteps.        With large offsets, we can end up with a tiny change in angle at each    radial step, so that rotSin and rotCos can get truncated to 0 and/or 1,    respectively. This means that we won't sweep the entire radial distance,    throwing future calculations off. Instead in this case we should fail.
