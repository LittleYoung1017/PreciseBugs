    health_check: fix divide-by-zero in retry interval calculations. (#4737)
    
    A fuzz failure indicated a divide-by-zero in HealthCheckerImplBase::interval(). Beyond this, on
    inspection, it seems we allow zero retry intervals, which can live lock the main thread. This PR
    fixes these issues.
    
    Fixes oss-fuzz issue https://bugs.chromium.org/p/oss-fuzz/issues/detail?id=10786.
    
    Risk Level: Low
    Testing: Additional unit test and a corpus entry added.
