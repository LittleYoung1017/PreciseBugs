    Fix use-after-free error discovered by the fuzzer.
    
    When eliminating a CFG node, we now flag its exit nodes; if our
    optimization pass reaches one of those flagged nodes, we stop the
    current optimization process in its tracks and initiate a rescan.
    
    We do NOT recursively mark the exits of the exit nodes, so this fix is
    reliant on the CFG being ordered in a non-chaotic fashion, but in
    practice this seems to be sufficient for the CFGs we generate today.
