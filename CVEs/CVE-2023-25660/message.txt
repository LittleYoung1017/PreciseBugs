TensorFlow is an open source platform for machine learning. Prior to versions 2.12.0 and 2.11.1, when the parameter `summarize` of `tf.raw_ops.Print` is zero, the new method `SummarizeArray<bool>` will reference to a nullptr, leading to a seg fault. A fix is included in TensorFlow version 2.12 and version 2.11.1.
