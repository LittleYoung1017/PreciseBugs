commit f8ec5a1d4c002a6bdfcec6b2582f66d58d32003cAuthor: Nikita Popov <nikita.ppv@gmail.com>Date:  Mon Nov 1 12:29:48 2021 +0100  Fix range inference hang    We shouldn't switch from range to no range for ZEND_DIV and instead  explicitly return an overflowing range. Otherwise the range will  not actually get updated during widening, and we'll perform  essentially infinite narrowing.    Fixes oss-fuzz #40566.
