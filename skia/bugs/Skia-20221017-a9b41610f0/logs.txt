    Fix fuzzer-discovered error with sk_RTAdjust.
    
    At http://review.skia.org/591260, I replaced an impossible-looking
    error condition if-check with an assertion. The fuzzer helpfully
    generated a test case for me which demonstrates how this error could
    occur after all. This CL restores the original if-check as-is, and
    adds the test case that exercises it.
    
    (I think there's likely a deeper error here as well--we should have
    rejected the global variable because its name overlaps with the
    interface block variable that also exists at global scope.)
