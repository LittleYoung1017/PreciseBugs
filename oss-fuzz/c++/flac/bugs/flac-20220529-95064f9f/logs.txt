commit 95064f9f083ac9520a17f2ba880e114643dcbeacAuthor: Martijn van Beurden <mvanb1@gmail.com>Date:   Sat May 28 22:13:23 2022 +0200    Fix fuzzer_decoder timeouts        fuzzer_decoder was running into timeouts because it triggered the    gap-filling for broken frames with 5*192000 samples and a blocksize    of 1, causing the write callback to be called 960000 times. Doing    this several times in one file caused a single fuzz run to take    > 60 seconds        This commit limits the minimum blocksize to 16 samples, and the    maximum number of frames emitted to 50        Credit: Oss-Fuzz    Issue: https://bugs.chromium.org/p/oss-fuzz/issues/detail?id=47193
