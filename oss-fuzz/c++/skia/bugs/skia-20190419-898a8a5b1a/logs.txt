commit 898a8a5b1a8135bf3d30285592e6fab0ac21a2f1Author: Ethan Nicholas <ethannicholas@google.com>Date:   Fri Apr 19 09:39:14 2019 -0400    Fixed internal skslc error with negated literal vectors        There was a spot where we were assuming that a constant vector was    guaranteed to be a vector constructor (e.g. float4(1)), while ignoring    the possibility that it could be a prefix operator applied to a    constructor (-float4(1)), leading to a crash. This fixes that and    simplifies the logic.
