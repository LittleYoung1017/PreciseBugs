commit b6dcab2cbb82fb775180d331462641f2e675bd02Author: Nikita Popov <nikita.ppv@gmail.com>Date:  Mon Jul 19 12:08:03 2021 +0200  Fix assert with attribute + first-class callable in assert    This is going to result in a compile-time error, but AST printing  is invoked first and should handle it gracefully. Handle it by  falling back to more generic printing code.    Fixes oss-fuzz #36264.
