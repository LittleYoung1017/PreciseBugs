commit dcd4b7304941a8832fba2d0fc4c1e716e7a4e72cAuthor: Rob Davies <rmd+git@sanger.ac.uk>Date:   Mon Jul 13 11:48:49 2020 +0100    Fix check for VCF record size        The check for excessive record size in vcf_parse_format() only    looked at individual fields.  It was therefore possible to    exceed the limit and overflow fmt_aux_t::offset by having    multiple fields with a combined size that went over INT_MAX.    Fix by including the amount of memory used so far in the check.        Credit to OSS-Fuzz    Fixes oss-fuzz 24097
