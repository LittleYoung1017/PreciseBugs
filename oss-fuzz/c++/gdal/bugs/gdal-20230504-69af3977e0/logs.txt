commit 69af3977e0610e351fec140a43aad58eca1e1e3eAuthor: Even Rouault <even.rouault@spatialys.com>Date:   Thu May 4 18:27:59 2023 +0200    SDTS: fix reading of polygon geometries (fixes #7680)        Partially reverts commit 909a1dece84a07f2d4592860473b9080ddcd6ddd        I've verified that reverting this bogus if( !IsIndexed() ) return;    statement doesn't cause any memory use issue with the datasets of    https://bugs.chromium.org/p/oss-fuzz/issues/detail?id=2773 both in    master, as well as going back to 2.3dev at commit    909a1dece84a07f2d4592860473b9080ddcd6ddd , so I'm not sure why this was    added at that time.
