    Fix fuzzer-discovered error with sk_FragColor.
    
    This built-in variable scanner would look for `sk_FragColor` or
    `sk_Clockwise` in the symbol table and attempt to add them to your
    program. However, if the user code had defined a symbol with this
    name, there was nothing stopping the code from finding that user-
    declared symbol instead. Now we explicitly only look in the built-in
    symbol tables.
