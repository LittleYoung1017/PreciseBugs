commit 2d467abc46ec4ee97484d4e35909bed322600037Author: Nikita Popov <nikita.ppv@gmail.com>Date:   Mon Dec 7 12:33:23 2020 +0100    Fix another typed resource issue in unserialization        We also need to discard old entries in the ref_props HT when values    are overwritten.        We should really forbid these kinds of overwrites. I believe they    can only occur in manually crafted serialization strings, and    cause so many problems...        Fixes oss-fuzz #28257.
