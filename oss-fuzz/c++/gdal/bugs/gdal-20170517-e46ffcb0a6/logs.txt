commit e46ffcb0a65966ff768368b23d6c51d164fd27f5Author: Even Rouault <even.rouault@mines-paris.org>Date:   Wed May 17 15:41:54 2017 +0000    GTiff: lower number of simulated strips to allow strip chopping to 10 million, so as to avoid excessive memory usage. This is still a huge image, so that shouldn't cause issues except for marginal use cases. Fixes https://bugs.chromium.org/p/oss-fuzz/issues/detail?id=1649.
