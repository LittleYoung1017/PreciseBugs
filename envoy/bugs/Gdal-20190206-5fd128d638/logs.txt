    maglev: fix handling of unspecified locality weights. (#5863)
    
    The config fuzzer showed that the locality weight assertion in
    https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/pull/5831 was too strong. Extant behavior was and is that if
    locality weight is not specified and locality LB weighting, we should just ignore the locality.
    
    Fixes oss-fuzz issue https://bugs.chromium.org/p/oss-fuzz/issues/detail?id=12923.
    
    Risk level: Low
    Testing: Corpus entry and unit test added.
