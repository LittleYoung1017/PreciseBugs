    Bug 703326: Create a new clip path for clist typed image handling
    
    Stupid fuzzing file uses a Type 3 font with a sampled image in the glyph
    proc. The image uses a procedure as a data source. The glyph proc does
    gsave, and the image data source procedure does a grestore. So by the time we
    clean up the image "samples", the gstate and the clip path it contains have
    gone. So the image enumerator's reference to the clip path is left dangling.
    
    Copying, rather than referencing, that clip path solves the crash.
    
    Fixes oss-fuzz issue: 26987
