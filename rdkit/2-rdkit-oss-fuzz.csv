Accessing `numIts + 1`    resulted in an out-of-bounds write. This commit skip the cipEntries    update when the rank is unchanged.        Fix https://bugs.chromium.org/p/oss-fuzz/issues/detail?id=28660        * Fix use of uninitialized values in MolSGroupParsing        `stream >> count` may silently fail without an exception. In that case,    `count` was uninitialized but used. This commit initalizes `count` to 0,    as well as other variables that may be read without being initialized.        Fix https://bugs.chromium.org/p/oss-fuzz/issues/detail?id=25220    Fix https://bugs.chromium.org/p/oss-fuzz/issues/detail?id=25225        * Fix vector size cast in streamReadVec        In 32-bit systems, the implicit conversions from 64-bit to a 32-bit    size_t could lead to an underallocation of the vector. This would follow    by a out-of-bounds write while trying to populate the vector. Now, the    code throws an exception in case of a cast that would change the size.        Fix https://bugs.chromium.org/p/oss-fuzz/issues/detail?id=28034        * RWMol: improve atom replacement in stereo groups        This code is cleaner and more efficient.        * Add test for replaceAtom and stereo groups	36998,	Code/GraphMol/Chirality.cpp;Code/GraphMol/FileParsers/MolSGroupParsing.cpp;Code/GraphMol/RWMol.cpp;Code/GraphMol/catch_chirality.cpp;Code/RDGeneral/StreamOps.h	1038;942;1009;151;1738;307
