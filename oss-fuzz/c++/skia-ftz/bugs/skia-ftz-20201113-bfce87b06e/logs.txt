commit bfce87b06e400ec62c2e0cee1c68c4a8fb4d1e9fAuthor: John Stiles <johnstiles@google.com>Date:   Thu Nov 12 16:03:23 2020 -0500    Fix fuzzing error with duplicate function definitions.        Without an early return, the inliner tries to inline a function inside    of itself, eating up gigabytes of memory before hitting its inline    threshold.        This normally wouldn't be possible because functions are meant to be    fully assembled before they're added to the list of ProgramElements, so    the inliner shouldn't find a function as a candidate to be inlined into    itself at all. However, the fuzzer found that an existing function    could be extended by re-declaring it; in this case, it is findable as    a ProgramElement and becomes inlinable.
