commit 963446e229c96cbeed59265bb9fde624b2e3e99cAuthor: Aleks L <93376818+sashashura@users.noreply.github.com>Date:   Sun Jul 24 15:08:56 2022 +0100    Fixes Use-of-uninitialized-value in LibRaw::init_fuji_block        https://bugs.chromium.org/p/oss-fuzz/issues/detail?id=46244        The root cause is up in the stack. The `unsigned *block_sizes` in the `LibRaw::fuji_compressed_load_raw` is allocated with memory for one `unsigned` integer.    Then it is initialized from the stream `libraw_internal_data.internal_data.input->read(block_sizes, 1, sizeof(unsigned) * libraw_internal_data.unpacker_data.fuji_total_blocks);`    However if the stream position is close to the end and there is no enough data to fill all buffer, some bytes are left uninitialized.
