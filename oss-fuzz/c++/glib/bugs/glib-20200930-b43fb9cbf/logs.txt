commit b43fb9cbfb033132e970f8b587d709c582dee1a0Author: Philip Withnall <pwithnall@endlessos.org>Date:   Wed Sep 30 18:52:18 2020 +0100    guri: Fix URI scope parsing        The previous parsing code could read off the end of a URI if it had an    incorrect %-escaped character in.        Fix that, and more closely implement parsing for the syntax defined in    RFC 6874, which is the amendment to RFC 3986 which specifies zone ID    syntax.        This requires reworking some network-address tests, which were    previously treating zone IDs incorrectly.        oss-fuzz#23816        Signed-off-by: Philip Withnall <pwithnall@endlessos.org>
