commit d1746ba0a5e46c2580a54f1b889cea6d8369832cAuthor: Micah Snyder <micasnyd@cisco.com>Date:   Tue Jan 25 16:12:41 2022 -0800    Fix possible double-free in OLE2 document parser        If realloc() is called with size == 0, realloc() will free the pointer    and return NULL. Unless you check for this and set the pointer to NULL,    the pointer may later be free'd again after the `done:` label.        This commit fixes it by using the new CLI_REALLOC macro. CLI_REALLOC    uses `cli_realloc()` that both limits the amoutn of memory that may be    allocated and also will return NULL if you try to set size == 0, WITHOUT    free'ing the memory.
