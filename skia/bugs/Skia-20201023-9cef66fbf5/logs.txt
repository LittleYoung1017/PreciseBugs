    Fix use-after-free discovered by fuzzer.
    
    In cases where multiple variables were declared on a single line, it is
    legal for variable initialization-expressions to reference variables
    declared earlier in the var-decl statement. It is NOT legal for the
    inliner to move those references up to the previous statement, where the
    variable doesn't exist yet.
    
    This is mitigated by disabling the IRGenerator inliner for var-decls
    past the first one in a var-decls statement. (The optimizer will still
    pass over this code later and is able to inline it correctly, if it is
    worth doing.)
