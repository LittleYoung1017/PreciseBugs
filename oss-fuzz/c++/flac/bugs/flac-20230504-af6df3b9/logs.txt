commit af6df3b9532ec88ef6e2a8cfa4b84f5ae7cdb06eAuthor: Martijn van Beurden <mvanb1@gmail.com>Date:   Thu May 4 14:58:48 2023 +0200    Fix cuesheet parsing code skipping a digit        The code parsing cuepoints of the form MM:SS.SS, which is only    allowed for non-CDDA, had a bug where the first S of the above    template was skipped. That meant that 00:12.34 was parsed as    00:02.34. This is not covered in the test suite, but fuzzing    stumbled on it as 00: as input made the parser skip the string-    terminating nul.
