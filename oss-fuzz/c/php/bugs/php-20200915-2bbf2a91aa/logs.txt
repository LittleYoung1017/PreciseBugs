commit 2bbf2a91aacd59d3511b5e22cac064d708140caaAuthor: Nikita Popov <nikita.ppv@gmail.com>Date:   Tue Sep 15 15:25:22 2020 +0200    Fix assumption about property guard hash value        The "member" string here does not necessarily have a pre-calculated    hash value. In particular this is not the case if the class has no    properties.        Fixes oss-fuzz #25546.
