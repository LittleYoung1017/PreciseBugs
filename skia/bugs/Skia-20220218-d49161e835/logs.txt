    More PolyUtils fixes.
    
    First, the convex check still had a bug when determining if we've
    wrapped around more than once. If the delta between two coordinates was
    0, then that doesn't trigger a sign change (as expected), but it
    will get copied as the next value to check against. Instead we should
    be checking against the previous non-zero value.
    
    Second, the ActiveEdgeList for isSimple had a bug where two very large
    segments were ending up with equal p0 and v values due to floating
    point error. Added a check for this and we'll treat those edges as
    effectively coincident.
