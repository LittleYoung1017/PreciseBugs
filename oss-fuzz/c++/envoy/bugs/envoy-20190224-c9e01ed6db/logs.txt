commit c9e01ed6db5de00099cb6daaf9e34612d8b5f302Author: htuch <htuch@users.noreply.github.com>Date:   Sun Feb 24 21:38:44 2019 -0500    buffer: fix handling of empty string prepends. (#6042)        Prepending an empty string seems to mess up libevent internally.    evbuffer_prepend doesn't have a check for empty (unlike evbuffer_prepend_buffer    which does). This then results in an allocation of an empty chain, which causes    problems with a following move/append. This only seems to happen the the    original buffer was created via addBufferFragment(), this forces the code    execution path in evbuffer_prepend related to immutable buffers.        Fixes oss-fuzz issue https://bugs.chromium.org/p/oss-fuzz/issues/detail?id=13263.        Risk level: Low    Testing: Corpus entry and unit test added.
